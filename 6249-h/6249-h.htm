    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a book called 'The House of Harper', published in this year, 1912,
      there are two letters of mine, concerning 'The Right of Way', written to
      Henry M. Alden, editor of Harper's Magazine. To my mind those letters
      should never have been published. They were purely personal. They were
      intended for one man's eyes only, and he was not merely an editor but a
      beloved and admired personal friend. Only to him and to W. E. Henley, as
      editors, could I ever have emptied out my heart and brain; and, as may be
      seen by these two letters, one written from London and the other from a
      place near Southampton, I uncovered all my feelings, my hopes and my
      ambitions concerning The Right of Way. Had I been asked permission to
      publish them I should not have granted it. I may wear my heart upon my
      sleeve for my friend, but not for the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most scathing thing ever said in literature was said by Robert
      Buchanan on Dante Gabriel Rossetti's verses&mdash;"He has wheeled his
      nuptial bed into the street." Looking at these letters I have a great
      shrinking, for they were meant only for the eyes of an aged man for whom I
      cared enough to let him see behind the curtain. But since they have been
      printed, and without a "by your leave," I will use one or two passages in
      them to show in what mood, under what pressure of impulse, under what
      mental and, maybe, spiritual hypnotism it was written. I first planned it
      as a story of twenty-five thousand words, even as 'Valmond' was planned as
      a story of five thousand words, and 'A Ladder of Swords' as a story of
      twenty thousand words; but I had not written three chapters before I saw
      what the destiny of the tale was to be. I had gone to Quebec to start the
      thing in the atmosphere where Charley Steele belonged, and there it was
      borne in upon me that it must be a three-decker novel, not a novelette. I
      telegraphed to Harper &amp; Brothers to ask them whether it would suit
      them just as well if I made it into a long novel. They telegraphed their
      assent at once; so I went on. At that time Mr. F. N. Doubleday was a sort
      of director of Harper's firm. To him I had told the tale in a railway
      train, and he had carried me off at once to Henry M. Alden, to whom I also
      told it, with the result that Harper's Magazine was wide open to it, and
      there in Quebec, soon after my interview with Mr. Alden and Mr. Doubleday,
      the book was begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of the letters published in The House of Harper, however, was
      apparently written immediately after my return to London when the novel
      was well on its way. Evidently the first paragraph of the letter was an
      apology for having suddenly announced the development of the book from a
      long short story to a long novel; for I used these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet if you really take an interest in the working of the human mind in
      its relation to the vicissitudes of life, you will appreciate what I am
      going to tell you, and will recognise that there is only stability in
      evolution which the vulgar call chance.... Now, sir, perpend. Charley
      Steele is going to be a novel of one hundred thousand words or one hundred
      and twenty thousand&mdash;a real bang-up heartful of a novel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there follows the confidence of a friend to a friend. As I look at
      the words I am not sorry that I wrote them. They were a part of me. They
      were the inveterate truth, but I would not willingly have uncovered my
      inner self to any except the man to whom the words were written. But here
      is what I wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a bit of a fool over this book. It catches me at every tender corner
      of my nature. It has aroused all the old ardent dreams of youth and
      springtime puissance. I cannot lay it down, and I cannot shorten it, for
      story, character, soul and reflection, imagination, observation are
      dragging me along after them.... This novel will make me or break me&mdash;prove
      me human and an artist, or an affected literary bore. If you want it you
      must take the risk. But, my dear Alden, you will be investing in a man's
      heart&mdash;which may be a fortune or a folly. Why, I ought to have seen&mdash;and
      far back in my brain I did see&mdash;that the character of Charley Steele
      was a type, an idiosyncrasy of modern life, a resultant of forces all
      round us, and that he would demand space in which to live and tell his
      story to the world.... And behold with what joy I follow him, not only
      lovingly but sternly and severely, noting him down as he really is,
      condoning naught, forgiving naught, but above all else, understanding him&mdash;his
      wilful mystification of the world, his shameless disdain of it, but the
      old law of interrogation, of sad yet eager inquiry and wonder and 'non
      possumus' with him to the end."
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter was evidently written in December, 1899, and the other went to
      Mr. Alden on the 7th August, 1900; therefore, eight or nine months later.
      The work had gone well. Week after week, month after month it had unfolded
      itself with an almost unpardonable ease. Evidently, the very ease with
      which the book was written troubled me, because I find that in this letter
      of the 7th August, 1900, to Mr. Alden, I used these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A kind of terror has seized me, and instead of sending a dozen more
      chapters to you as I proposed to do, I am setting to to break this love
      story anew under the stones of my most exacting criticism and troubled
      regard. I go to bury myself at a solitary little seaside place" (it was
      Mablethorpe in Lincolnshire), "there to live alone with Rosalie and
      Charley, and if I do not know them hereafter, never ask me to write for
      'Harper's' again.... This book has been written out of something vital in
      me&mdash;I do not mean the religious part of it, I mean the humanity that
      becomes one's own and part of one's self, by observation, experience, and
      understanding got from dead years."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow that shows the spirit in which the book was written, and there must
      have been something in it that rang true, because not only did it have an
      enormous sale and therefore a multitude of readers, but I received
      hundreds of letters from people who in one way or another were deeply
      interested in the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of them were inquisitive letters. A great many of them said
      that the writer had shared in controversy as to what the relations of
      Charley and Rosalie were, and asked me to set for ever queries and
      controversies at rest by declaring either that the relations of these two
      were what, in the way of life's stern conventions, they ought not to be,
      or that Rosalie passed unscathed through the fire. I had foreseen all
      this, though I could not have foreseen the passionately intense interest
      which my readers would take in the life-story of these unhappy yet happy
      people. I had, however, only one reply. It was that all I had meant to say
      concerning Charley and Rosalie had been said in the book, to the last
      word. All I had meant not to say would not be said after the book was
      written. I asked them to take exactly the same view of Charley and Rosalie
      as they would in real life regarding two human beings with whom they were
      acquainted, and concerning whom, to their minds, there was sufficient
      evidence, or not sufficient evidence, to come to a conclusion as to what
      their relations were. I added that, as in real life we used our judgment
      upon such things with a reasonable amount of accuracy, I asked them to
      apply that judgment to Charley Steele and Rosalie Evanturel. They and
      their story were there for eyes to see and read, and when I had ended my
      manuscript in the year 1900 I had said the last word I ever meant to say
      as to their history. The controversy therefore continues, for the book
      still makes its appeal to an ever increasing congregation of new readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But another kind of letter came to me&mdash;the letter of some man who had
      just such a struggle as Charley Steele, or whose father or brother or
      friend had had such a struggle. Letters came from clergymen who had
      preached concerning the book; from men who told me in brief their own life
      problems and tragedies. These letters I prize; most of them had the real
      thing in them, the human truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the book drew wide attention to the Dominion of Canada, particularly
      to French Canada, and crystallised something of the life of that dear
      Province, was a deep pleasure to me; and I was glad that I had been able
      to culminate my efforts to portray the life of the French-Canadian as I
      saw it, by a book which arrested the attention of so comprehensive a
      public.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have seen many statements as to the original of Charley Steele, but I
      have never seen a story which was true. Many people have told me that they
      had seen the original of Charley Steele in an American lawyer. They knew
      he was the original, because he himself had said so. The gentleman was
      mistaken; I have never seen him. As with the purple cow, I never hope to
      see him. Whoever he is or whatever he is, the original Charley was an
      abler and a more striking man. I knew him as a boy, and he died while I
      was yet a boy, taking with him, save in the memory of a few, a rare and
      wonderful, if not wholly lovable personality. For over twenty years I had
      carried him in my mind, wondering whether, and when, I should-make use of
      him. Again and again I was tempted, but was never convinced that his time
      had come; yet through all the years he was gaining strength, securing
      possession of my mind, and gathering to him, magnet-like, the thousand
      observations which my experience sent in his direction. In my mind his
      life-story ended with his death at the Cote Dorion. For years and years I
      saw his ending there. Yet it all seemed to me so futile, despite the
      wonder of his personality, that I could make nothing of him, and though
      always fascinated by his character I was held back from exploiting it,
      because of the hopelessness of it all. It led nowhere. It was the 'quid
      refert' of the philosopher, and I could not bring myself to get any
      further than an interrogation mark at the end of a life which was all
      scepticism, mind and matter, and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a day, however, when that all ended, when the doors were flung
      wide to a new conception of the man, and of what he might have become. I
      was going to America, and I paid an angry and reluctant visit to my London
      tailor thirty-six hours before I was to start. A suit of clothes had been
      sent home which, after an effective trying-on, was a monstrosity. I went
      straight to my tailor, put on the clothes and bade him look at them. He
      was a great tailor-he saw exactly what I saw, and what I saw was bad; and
      when a tailor will do that, you may be quite sure he is a good and a great
      man. He said the clothes were as bad as they could be, but he added: "You
      shall have them before you sail, and they shall be exactly as you want
      them. I'll have the foreman down." He rang a bell. Presently the door
      swung open and in stepped a man with an eyeglass in his eye. There, with a
      look at once reflective and penetrating, with a figure at once slovenly
      and alert, was a caricature of Charley Steele as I had known him, and of
      all his characteristics. There was such a resemblance as an ugly child in
      a family may have to his handsome brother. It was Charley Steele with a
      twist&mdash;gone to seed. Looking at him in blank amazement, I burst out:
      "Good heavens, so you didn't die, Charley Steele! You became a tailor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once the whole new landscape of my story as it eventually became,
      spread out before me. I was justified in waiting all the years. My
      discontent with the futile end of the tale as I originally knew it and saw
      it was justified. Charley Steele, brilliant, enigmatic and epigrammatic,
      did not die at the Cote Dorion, but lived in that far valley by Dalgrothe
      Mountain, and became a tailor! So far as I am concerned he became much
      more. He was the beginning of a new epoch in my literary life. I had got
      into subtler methods, reached more intimate understandings, had come to a
      place where analysis of character had shaken itself free&mdash;but
      certainly not quite free&mdash;from a natural yet rather dangerous
      eloquence.

      As a play The Right of Way, skilfully and sympathetically dramatised by
      Mr. Eugene Presbery, has had a career extending over several years, and
      still continues to make its appearance.

    <p>
      It should not be assumed that the "Chaudiere" of this story is the real
      Chaudiere of Quebec province. The name is characteristic, and for this
      reason alone I have used it.

      I must also apologise to my readers for appearing to disregard a statement
      made in 'The Lane that Had no Turning', that that tale was the last I
      should write about French Canada. In explanation I would say that 'The
      Lane that Had no Turning' was written after the present book was finished.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE WAY TO THE VERDICT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "Not guilty, your Honour!"
    </h3>
    <p>
      A hundred atmospheres had seemed pressing down on the fretted people in
      the crowded court-room. As the discordant treble of the huge foreman of
      the jury squeaked over the mass of gaping humanity, which had twitched at
      skirts, drawn purposeless hands across prickling faces, and kept nervous
      legs at a gallop, the smothering weights of elastic air lifted suddenly, a
      great suspiration of relief swept through the place like a breeze, and in
      a far corner of the gallery a woman laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge looked up reprovingly at the gallery; the clerk of the court
      angrily called "Silence!" towards the offending corner, and seven or eight
      hundred eyes raced between three centres of interest&mdash;the judge, the
      prisoner, and the prisoner's counsel. Perhaps more people looked at the
      prisoner's counsel than at the prisoner, certainly far more than looked at
      the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was a verdict more unexpected. If a poll had been taken of the
      judgment of the population twenty-four hours before, a great majority
      would have been found believing that there was no escape for the prisoner,
      who was accused of murdering a wealthy timber merchant. The minority would
      have based their belief that the prisoner had a chance of escape, not on
      his possible innocence, not on insufficient evidence, but on a curious
      faith in the prisoner's lawyer. This minority would not have been composed
      of the friends of the lawyer alone, but of outside spectators, who,
      because Charley Steele had never lost a criminal case, attached to him a
      certain incapacity for bad luck; and of very young men, who looked upon
      him as the perfect pattern of the person good to see and hard to
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first two days of the trial the case had gone wholly against
      the prisoner, who had given his name as Joseph Nadeau. Witnesses had heard
      him quarrelling with the murdered man, and the next day the body of the
      victim had been found by the roadside. The prisoner was a stranger in the
      lumber-camp where the deed was done, and while there had been morose and
      lived apart; no one knew him; and he refused to tell even his lawyer
      whence he came, or what his origin, or to bring witnesses from his home to
      speak for his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the points had been made against him&mdash;with no perceptible
      effect upon Charley Steele, who seemed the one cool, undisturbed person in
      the courtroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indifferent as he seemed, seldom speaking to the prisoner, often looking
      out of the windows to the cool green trees far over on the hill, absorbed
      and unbusinesslike, yet judge and jury came to see, before the second day
      was done, that he had let no essential thing pass, that the questions he
      asked had either a pregnant aptness, opened up new avenues of
      deliberation, or were touched with mystery&mdash;seemed to have a longer
      reach than the moment or the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the end of this second day, however, more attention was upon him
      than upon the prisoner, and nine-tenths of the people in the court-room
      could have told how many fine linen handkerchiefs he used during the
      afternoon, how many times he adjusted his monocle to look at the judge
      meditatively. Probably no man, for eight hours a day, ever exasperated and
      tried a judge, jury, and public, as did this man of twenty-nine years of
      age, who had been known at college as Beauty Steele, and who was still so
      spoken of familiarly; or was called as familiarly, Charley Steele, by
      people who never had attempted to be familiar with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second day of the trial had ended gloomily for the prisoner. The coil
      of evidence had drawn so close that extrication seemed impossible. That
      the evidence was circumstantial, that no sign of the crime was upon the
      prisoner, that he was found sleeping quietly in his bed when he was
      arrested, that he had not been seen to commit the deed, did not weigh in
      the minds of the general public. The man's guilt was freely believed; not
      even the few who clung to the opinion that Charley Steele would yet get
      him off thought that he was innocent. There seemed no flaw in the
      evidence, once granted its circumstantiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last two hours of the sitting the prisoner had looked at his
      counsel in despair, for he seemed perfunctorily conducting the case: was
      occupied in sketching upon the blotting-pad before him, looking out of the
      window, or turning his head occasionally towards a corner where sat a
      half-dozen well-dressed ladies, and more particularly towards one lady who
      watched him in a puzzled way&mdash;more than once with a look of
      disappointment. Only at the very close of the sitting did he appear to
      rouse himself. Then, for a brief ten minutes, he cross-examined a friend
      of the murdered merchant in a fashion which startled the court-room, for
      he suddenly brought out the fact that the dead man had once struck a woman
      in the face in the open street. This fact, sharply stated by the
      prisoner's counsel, with no explanation and no comment, seemed uselessly
      intrusive and malicious. His ironical smile merely irritated all
      concerned. The thin, clean-shaven face of the prisoner grew more pinched
      and downcast, and he turned almost pleadingly towards the judge. The judge
      pulled his long side-whiskers nervously, and looked over his glasses in
      severe annoyance, then hastily adjourned the sitting and left the bench,
      while the prisoner saw with dismay his lawyer leave the court-room with
      not even a glance towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the third day Charley Steele's face, for the first time,
      wore an expression which, by a stretch of imagination, might be called
      anxious. He also took out his monocle frequently, rubbed it with his
      handkerchief, and screwed it in again, staring straight before him much of
      the time. But twice he spoke to the prisoner in a low voice, and was
      hurriedly answered in French as crude as his own was perfect. When he
      spoke, which was at rare intervals, his voice was without feeling,
      concise, insistent, unappealing. It was as though the business before him
      was wholly alien to him, as though he were held there against his will,
      but would go on with his task bitterly to the bitter end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court adjourned for an hour at noon. During this time Charley refused
      to see any one, but sat alone in his office with a few biscuits and an
      ominous bottle before him, till the time came for him to go back to the
      court-house. Arrived there he entered by a side door, and was not seen
      until the court opened once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two hours and a half the crown attorney mercilessly made out his case
      against the prisoner. When he sat down, people glanced meaningly at each
      other, as though the last word had been said, then looked at the prisoner,
      as at one already condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Charley Steele was to reply. He was not now the same man that had
      conducted the case during the past two days and a half. Some great change
      had passed over him. There was no longer abstraction, indifference, or
      apparent boredom, or disdain, or distant stare. He was human, intimate and
      eager, yet concentrated and impelling: he was quietly, unnoticeably drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He assured the prisoner with a glance of the eye, with a word scarce above
      a whisper, as he slowly rose to make his speech for the defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first words caused a new feeling in the courtroom. He was a new
      presence; the personality had a changed significance. At first the public,
      the jury, and the judge were curiously attracted, surprised into a fresh
      interest. The voice had an insinuating quality, but it also had a measured
      force, a subterranean insistence, a winning tactfulness. Withal, a logical
      simplicity governed his argument. The flaneur, the poseur&mdash;if such he
      was&mdash;no longer appeared. He came close to the jurymen, leaned his
      hands upon the back of a chair&mdash;as it were, shut out the public, even
      the judge, from his circle of interest&mdash;and talked in a
      conversational tone. An air of confidence passed from him to the amazed
      yet easily captivated jury; the distance between them, so gaping during
      the last two days, closed suddenly up. The tension of the past
      estrangement, relaxing all at once, surprised the jury into an almost
      eager friendliness, as on a long voyage a sensitive traveller finds in
      some exciting accident a natural introduction to an exclusive
      fellow-passenger, whom he discovers as human as he had thought him
      offensively distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley began by congratulating the crown attorney on his statement of the
      case. He called it masterly; he said that in its presentations it was
      irrefutable; as a precis of evidence purely circumstantial it was&mdash;useful
      and interesting. But, speech-making aside, and ability&mdash;and rhetoric&mdash;aside,
      and even personal conviction aside, the case should stand or fall by its
      total, not its comparative, soundness. Since the evidence was purely
      circumstantial, there must be no flaw in its cable of assumption, it must
      be logically inviolate within itself. Starting with assumption only, there
      must be no straying possibilities, no loose ends of certainty, no invading
      alternatives. Was this so in the case of the man before them? They were
      faced by a curious situation. So far as the trial was concerned, the
      prisoner himself was the only person who could tell them who he was, what
      was his past, and, if he committed the crime, what was&mdash;the motive of
      it: out of what spirit&mdash;of revenge, or hatred&mdash;the dead man had
      been sent to his account. Probably in the whole history of crime there
      never was a more peculiar case. Even himself the prisoner's counsel was
      dealing with one whose life was hid from him previous to the day the
      murdered man was discovered by the roadside. The prisoner had not sought
      to prove an alibi; he had done no more than formally plead not guilty.
      There was no material for defence save that offered by the prosecution. He
      had undertaken the defence of the prisoner because it was his duty as a
      lawyer to see that the law justified itself; that it satisfied every
      demand of proof to the last atom of certainty; that it met the final
      possibility of doubt with evidence perfect and inviolate if
      circumstantial, and uncontradictory if eye-witness, if tell-tale incident,
      were to furnish basis of proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge, jury, and public riveted their eyes upon Charley Steele. He had now
      drawn a little farther away from the jury-box; his eye took in the judge
      as well; once or twice he turned, as if appealingly and confidently, to
      the people in the room. It was terribly hot, the air was sickeningly
      close, every one seemed oppressed&mdash;every one save a lady sitting not
      a score of feet from where the counsel for the prisoner stood. This lady's
      face was not one that could flush easily; it belonged to a temperament as
      even as her person was symmetrically beautiful. As Charley talked, her
      eyes were fixed steadily, wonderingly upon him. There was a question in
      her gaze, which never in the course of the speech was quite absorbed by
      the admiration&mdash;the intense admiration&mdash;she was feeling for him.
      Once as he turned with a concentrated earnestness in her direction his
      eyes met hers. The message he flashed her was sub-conscious, for his mind
      never wavered an instant from the cause in hand, but it said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "When this is over, Kathleen, I will come to you." For another quarter of
      an hour he exposed the fallacy of purely circumstantial evidence; he
      raised in the minds of his hearers the painful responsibility of the law,
      the awful tyranny of miscarriage of justice; he condemned prejudice
      against a prisoner because that prisoner demanded that the law should
      prove him guilty instead of his proving himself innocent. If a man chose
      to stand to that, to sternly assume this perilous position, the law had no
      right to take advantage of it. He turned towards the prisoner and traced
      his possible history: as the sensitive, intelligent son of godly Catholic
      parents from some remote parish in French Canada. He drew an imaginary
      picture of the home from which he might have come, and of the parents and
      brothers and sisters who would have lived weeks of torture knowing that
      their son and brother was being tried for his life. It might at first
      glance seem quixotic, eccentric, but was it unnatural that the prisoner
      should choose silence as to his origin and home, rather than have his
      family and friends face the undoubted peril lying before him? Besides,
      though his past life might have been wholly blameless, it would not be
      evidence in his favour. It might, indeed, if it had not been blameless,
      provide some element of unjust suspicion against him, furnish some fancied
      motive. The prisoner had chosen his path, and events had so far justified
      him. It must be clear to the minds of judge and jury that there were
      fatally weak places in the circumstantial evidence offered for the
      conviction of this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the fact that no sign of the crime, no drop of blood, no weapon,
      was found about him or near him, and that he was peacefully sleeping at
      the moment the constable arrested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also the fact that no motive for the crime had been shown. It
      was not enough that he and the dead man had been heard quarrelling. Was
      there any certainty that it was a quarrel, since no word or sentence of
      the conversation had been brought into court? Men with quick tempers might
      quarrel over trivial things, but exasperation did not always end in bodily
      injury and the taking of life; imprecations were not so uncommon that they
      could be taken as evidence of wilful murder. The prisoner refused to say
      what that troubled conversation was about, but who could question his
      right to take the risk of his silence being misunderstood?
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge was alternately taking notes and looking fixedly at the
      prisoner; the jury were in various attitudes of strained attention; the
      public sat open mouthed; and up in the gallery a woman with white face and
      clinched hands listened moveless and staring. Charley Steele was holding
      captive the emotions and the judgments of his hearers. All antipathy had
      gone; there was a strange eager intimacy between the jurymen and himself.
      People no longer looked with distant dislike at the prisoner, but began to
      see innocence in his grim silence, disdain only in his surly defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Charley Steele had preserved his great stroke for the psychological
      moment. He suddenly launched upon them the fact, brought out in evidence,
      that the dead man had struck a woman in the face a year ago; also that he
      had kept a factory girl in affluence for two years. Here was motive for
      murder&mdash;if motive were to govern them&mdash;far greater than might be
      suggested by excited conversation which listeners who could not hear a
      word construed into a quarrel&mdash;listeners who bore the prisoner at the
      bar ill-will because he shunned them while in the lumber-camp. If the
      prisoner was to be hanged for motive untraceable, why should not these two
      women be hanged for motive traceable!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was his chance. He appeared to impeach subtly every intelligence in
      the room for having had any preconviction about the prisoner's guilt. He
      compelled the jury to feel that they, with him, had made the discovery of
      the unsound character of the evidence. The man might be guilty, but their
      personal guilt, the guilt of the law, would be far greater if they
      condemned the man on violable evidence. With a last simple appeal, his
      hands resting on the railing before the seat where the jury sat, his voice
      low and conversational again, his eyes running down the line of faces of
      the men who had his client's life in their hands, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not a life only that is at stake, it is not revenge for a life
      snatched from the busy world by a brutal hand that we should heed to-day,
      but the awful responsibility of that thing we call the State, which,
      having the power of life and death without gainsay or hindrance, should
      prove to the last inch of necessity its right to take a human life. And
      the right and the reason should bring conviction to every honest human
      mind. That is all I have to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      The crown attorney made a perfunctory reply. The judge's charge was brief,
      and, if anything, a little in favour of the prisoner&mdash;very little, a
      casuist's little; and the jury filed out of the room. They were gone but
      ten minutes. When they returned, the verdict was given: "Not guilty, your
      Honour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was that a woman laughed in the gallery. Then a whispering voice
      said across the railing which separated the public from the lawyers:
      "Charley! Charley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Charley turned and looked at the lady who spoke, he made no
      response.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later, outside the court, as he walked quickly away, again
      inscrutable and debonair, the prisoner, Joseph Nadeau, touched him on the
      arm and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "M'sieu', M'sieu', you have saved my life&mdash;I thank you, M'sieu'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley Steele drew his arm away with disgust. "Get out of my sight!
      You're as guilty as hell!" he said.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. WHAT CAME OF THE TRIAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      "When this is over, Kathleen, I will come to you." So Charley Steele's
      eyes had said to a lady in the court room on that last day of the great
      trial. The lady had left the court-room dazed and exalted. She, with
      hundreds of others, had had a revelation of Charley Steele; had had also
      the great emotional experience of seeing a crowd make the 'volte face'
      with their convictions; looking at a prisoner one moment with eyes of
      loathing and anticipating his gruesome end, the next moment seeing him as
      the possible martyr to the machinery of the law. She whose heart was used
      to beat so evenly had felt it leap and swell with excitement, awaiting the
      moment when the jury filed back into the court-room. Then it stood still,
      as a wave might hang for an instant at its crest ere it swept down to beat
      upon the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her as with most present, the deepest feeling in the agitated
      suspense was not so much that the prisoner should go free, as that the
      prisoner's counsel should win his case. It was as if Charley Steele were
      on trial instead of the prisoner. He was the imminent figure; it was his
      fate that was in the balance&mdash;such was the antic irony of suggestion.
      And the truth was, that the fates of both prisoner and counsel had been
      weighed in the balance that sweltering August day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner was forgotten almost as soon as he had left the court-room a
      free man, but wherever men and women met in Montreal that day, one name
      was on the lips of all-Charley Steele! In his speech he had done two
      things: he had thrown down every barrier of reserve&mdash;or so it seemed&mdash;and
      had become human and intimate. "I could not have believed it of him," was
      the remark on every lip. Of his ability there never had been a moment's
      doubt, but it had ever been an uncomfortable ability, it had tortured foes
      and made friends anxious. No one had ever seen him show feeling. If it was
      a mask, he had worn it with a curious consistency: it had been with him as
      a child, at school, at college, and he had brought it back again to the
      town where he was born. It had effectually prevented his being popular,
      but it had made him&mdash;with his foppishness and his originality&mdash;an
      object of perpetual interest. Few men had ventured to cross swords with
      him. He left his fellow-citizens very much alone. He was uniformly if
      distantly courteous, and he was respected in his own profession for his
      uncommon powers and for an utter indifference as to whether he had cases
      in court or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming from the judge's chambers after the trial he went to his office,
      receiving as he passed congratulations more effusively offered than, as
      people presently found, his manner warranted.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he was again the formal, masked Charley Steele, looking calmly through
      the interrogative eye-glass. By the time he reached his office, greetings
      became more subdued. His prestige had increased immensely in a few short
      hours, but he had no more friends than before. Old relations were soon
      re-established. The town was proud of his ability as it had always been,
      irritated by his manner as it had always been, more prophetic of his
      future than it had ever been, and unconsciously grateful for the fact that
      he had given them a sensation which would outlast the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these things concerned him little. Once the business of the court-room
      was over, a thought which had quietly lain in waiting behind the strenuous
      occupations of his brain leaped forward to exclude all others.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered his office he was thinking of that girl's face in the
      court-room, with its flush of added beauty which he and his speech had
      brought there. "What a perfect loveliness!" he said to himself as he
      bathed his face and hands, and prepared to go into the street again. "She
      needed just such a flush to make her supreme Kathleen!" He stood, looking
      out into the square, out into the green of the trees where the birds
      twittered. "Faultless&mdash;faultless in form and feature. She was so as a
      child, she is so as a woman." He lighted a cigarette, and blew away little
      clouds of smoke. "I will do it. I will marry her. She will have me: I saw
      it in her eye. Fairing doesn't matter. Her uncle will never consent to
      that, and she doesn't care enough for him. She cares, but she doesn't care
      enough.... I will do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned towards a cupboard into which he had put a certain bottle before
      he went to the court-room two hours before. He put the key in the lock,
      then stopped. "No, I think not!" he said. "What I say to her shall not be
      said forensically. What a discovery I've made! I was dull, blank, all iron
      and ice; the judge, the jury, the public, even Kathleen, against me; and
      then that bottle in there&mdash;and I saw things like crystal! I had a
      glow in my brain, I had a tingle in my fingers; and I had success, and"&mdash;his
      face clouded&mdash;"He was as guilty as hell!" he added, almost bitterly,
      as he put the key of the cupboard into his pocket again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door, and a youth of about nineteen entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello!" he said. "I say, sir, but that speech of yours struck us all
      where we couldn't say no. Even Kathleen got in a glow over it. Perhaps
      Captain Fairing didn't, for he's just left her in a huff, and she's
      looking&mdash;you remember those lines in the school-book:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         "'A red spot burned upon her cheek,
          Streamed her rich tresses down&mdash;'"
</pre>
    <p>
      He laughed gaily. "I've come to ask you up to tea," he added. "The
      Unclekins is there. When I told him that Kathleen had sent Fairing away
      with a flea in his ear, he nearly fell off his chair. He lent me twenty
      dollars on the spot. Are you coming our way?" he continued, suddenly
      trying to imitate Charley's manner. Charley nodded, and they left the
      office together and moved away under a long avenue of maples to where, in
      the shade of a high hill, was the house of the uncle of Kathleen Wantage,
      with whom she and her brother Billy lived. They walked in silence for some
      time, and at last Billy said, 'a propos' of nothing:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fairing hasn't a red cent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a perambulating mind, Billy," said Charley, and bowed to a young
      clergyman approaching them from the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does that mean?" remarked Billy, and said "Hello!" to the young
      clergyman, and did not wait for Charley's answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. John Brown was by no means a conventional parson. He was smoking
      a cigarette, and two dogs followed at his heels. He was certainly not a
      fogy. He had more than a little admiration for Charley Steele, but he
      found it difficult to preach when Charley was in the congregation. He was
      always aware of a subterranean and half-pitying criticism going on in the
      barrister's mind. John Brown knew that he could never match his
      intelligence against Charley's, in spite of the theological course at
      Durham, so he undertook to scotch the snake by kindness. He thought that
      he might be able to do this, because Charley, who was known to be frankly
      agnostical, came to his church more or less regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. John Brown was not indifferent to what men thought of him. He had
      a reputation for being "independent," but his chief independence consisted
      in dressing a little like a layman, posing as the athletic parson of the
      new school, consorting with ministers of the dissenting denominations when
      it was sufficiently effective, and being a "good fellow" with men easily
      bored by church and churchmen. He preached theatrical sermons to societies
      and benevolent associations. He wanted to be thought well of on all hands,
      and he was shrewd enough to know that if he trimmed between ritualism on
      one hand and evangelicism on the other, he was on a safe road. He might
      perforate old dogmatical prejudices with a good deal of freedom so long as
      he did not begin bringing "millinery" into the service of the church. He
      invested his own personal habits with the millinery. He looked a
      picturesque figure with his blond moustache, a little silk-lined brown
      cloak thrown carelessly over his shoulder, a gold-headed cane, and a brisk
      jacket half ecclesiastical, half military.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had interested Charley Steele, also he had amused him, and sometimes he
      had surprised him into a sort of admiration; for Brown had a temperament
      capable of little inspirations&mdash;such a literary inspiration as might
      come to a second-rate actor&mdash;and Charley never belittled any man's
      ability, but seized upon every sign of knowledge with the appreciation of
      the epicure.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Brown raised his hat to Charley, then held out a hand.
      "Masterly-masterly!" he said. "Permit my congratulations. It was the one
      thing to do. You couldn't have saved him by making him an object of pity,
      by appealing to our sympathies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you take to be the secret, then?" asked Charley, with a look half
      abstracted, half quizzical. "Terror&mdash;sheer terror. You startled the
      conscience. You made defects in the circumstantial evidence, the imminent
      problems of our own salvation. You put us all on trial. We were under the
      lash of fear. If we parsons could only do that from the pulpit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will discuss that on our shooting-trip next week. Duck-shooting gives
      plenty of time for theological asides. You are coming, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John Brown scarcely noticed the sarcasm, he was so delighted at the
      suggestion that he was to be included in the annual duck-shoot of the
      Seven, as the little yearly party of Charley and his friends to Lake
      Aubergine was called. He had angled for this invitation for two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must not keep you," Charley said, and dismissed him with a bow. "The
      sheep will stray, and the shepherd must use his crook."
    </p>
    <p>
      Brown smiled at the badinage, and went on his way rejoicing in the fact
      that he was to share the amusements of the Seven at Lake Aubergine&mdash;the
      Lake of the Mad Apple. To get hold of these seven men of repute and
      position, to be admitted into this good presence!&mdash;He had a pious
      exaltation, but whether it was because he might gather into the fold
      erratic and agnostical sheep like Charley Steele, or because it pleased
      his social ambitions, he had occasion to answer in the future. He gaily
      prepared to go to the Lake of the Mad Apple, where he was fated to eat of
      the tree of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley Steele and Billy Wantage walked on slowly to the house under the
      hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's the right sort," said Billy. "He's a sport. I can stand that kind.
      Did you ever hear him sing? No? Well, he can sing a comic song fit to make
      you die. I can sing a bit myself, but to hear him sing 'The Man Who
      Couldn't Get Warm' is a show in itself. He can play the banjo too, and the
      guitar&mdash;but he's best on the banjo. It's worth a dollar to listen to
      his Epha-haam&mdash;that's Ephraim, you know&mdash;Ephahaam Come Home,'
      and 'I Found Y' in de Honeysuckle Paitch.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He preaches, too!" said Charley drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the door of the house under the hill, and Billy had no
      time for further remark. He ran into the drawing-room, announcing Charley
      with the words: "I say, Kathleen, I've brought the man that made the judge
      sit up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy suddenly stopped, however, for there sat the judge who had tried the
      case, calmly munching a piece of toast. The judge did not allow himself
      the luxury of embarrassment, but bowed to Charley with a smile, which he
      presently turned on Kathleen, who came as near being disconcerted as she
      had ever been in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen had passed through a good deal to look so unflurried. She had
      been on trial in the court-room as well as the prisoner. Important things
      had been at stake with her. She and Charley Steele had known each other
      since they were children. To her, even in childhood, he had been a
      dominant figure. He had judicially and admiringly told her she was
      beautiful&mdash;when he was twelve and she five. But he had said it
      without any of those glances which usually accompanied the same sentiments
      in the mouths of other lads. He had never made boy-love to her, and she
      had thrilled at the praise of less splendid people than Charley Steele. He
      had always piqued her, he was so superior to the ordinary enchantments of
      youth, beauty, and fine linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he came and went, growing older and more characteristic, more and more
      "Beauty Steele," accompanied by legends of wild deeds and days at college,
      by tales of his fopperies and the fashions he had set, she herself had
      grown, as he had termed it, more "decorative." He had told her so, not in
      the least patronisingly, but as a simple fact in which no sentiment
      lurked. He thought her the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, but he
      had never regarded her save as a creation for the perfect pleasure of the
      eye; he thought her the concrete glory of sensuous purity, no more capable
      of sentiment than himself. He had said again and again, as he grew older
      and left college and began the business of life after two years in Europe,
      that sentiment would spoil her, would scatter the charm of her perfect
      beauty; it would vitalise her too much, and her nature would lose its
      proportion; she would be decentralised! She had been piqued at his
      indifference to sentiment; she could not easily be content without
      worship, though she felt none. This pique had grown until Captain Tom
      Fairing crossed her path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairing was the antithesis of Charley Steele. Handsome, poor,
      enthusiastic, and none too able, he was simple and straightforward, and
      might be depended on till the end of the chapter. And the end of it was,
      that in so far as she had ever felt real sentiment for anybody, she felt
      it for Tom Fairing of the Royal Fusileers. It was not love she felt in the
      old, in the big, in the noble sense, but it had behind it selection and
      instinct and natural gravitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairing declared his love. She would give him no answer. For as soon as
      she was presented with the issue, the destiny, she began to look round her
      anxiously. The first person to fill the perspective was Charley Steele. As
      her mind dwelt on him, her uncle gave forth his judgment, that she should
      never have a penny if she married Tom Fairing. This only irritated her, it
      did not influence her. But there was Charley. He was a figure, was already
      noted in his profession because of a few masterly successes in criminal
      cases, and if he was not popular, he was distinguished, and the world
      would talk about him to the end. He was handsome, and he was well-to-do-he
      had a big unoccupied house on the hill among the maples. How many people
      had said, What a couple they would make-Charley Steele and Kathleen
      Wantage!
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as Fairing presented an issue to her, she concentrated her thoughts as
      she had never done before on the man whom the world set apart for her, in
      a way the world has.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she looked and looked, Charley began to look also. He had not been
      enamoured of the sordid things of the world; he had been merely curious.
      He thought vice was ugly; he had imagination and a sense of form. Kathleen
      was beautiful. Sentiment had, so he thought, never seriously disturbed
      her; he did not think it ever would. It had not affected him. He did not
      understand it. He had been born non-intime. He had had acquaintances, but
      never friendships, and never loves or love. But he had a fine sense of the
      fitting and the proportionate, and he worshipped beauty in so far as he
      could worship anything. The homage was cerebral, intellectual,
      temperamental, not of the heart. As he looked out upon the world half
      pityingly, half ironically, he was struck with wonder at the disproportion
      which was engendered by "having heart," as it was called. He did not find
      it necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that he had begun to think of marriage, who so suitable as Kathleen?
      He knew of Fairing's adoration, but he took it as a matter of course that
      she had nothing to give of the same sort in return. Her beauty was still
      serene and unimpaired. He would not spoil it by the tortures of emotion.
      He would try to make Kathleen's heart beat in harmony with his own; it
      should not thunder out of time. He had made up his mind that he would
      marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Kathleen, with the great trial, the beginning of the end had come.
      Charley's power over her was subtle, finely sensuous, and, in deciding,
      there were no mere heart-impulses working for Charley. Instinct and
      impulse were working in another direction. She had not committed her mind
      to either man, though her heart, to a point, was committed to Fairing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of the trial, however, she fell wholly under that influence
      which had swayed judge, jury, and public. To her the verdict of the jury
      was not in favour of the prisoner at the bar&mdash;she did not think of
      him. It was in favour of Charley Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, indifferent as to who heard, over the heads of the people in front
      of her, to the accused's counsel inside the railings, she had called,
      softly: "Charley! Charley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the house under the hill, they were face to face, and the end was
      at hand: the end of something and the beginning of something.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a few moments of casual conversation, in which Billy talked as
      much as anybody, and then Kathleen said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you suppose was the man's motive for committing the murder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley looked at Kathleen steadily, curiously, through his monocle. It
      was a singular compliment she paid him. Her remark took no heed of the
      verdict of the jury. He turned inquiringly towards the judge, who, though
      slightly shocked by the question, recovered himself quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think it was, sir?" Charley asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman&mdash;and revenge, perhaps," answered the judge, with a
      matter-of-course air.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments afterwards the judge was carried off by Kathleen's uncle to
      see some rare old books; Billy, his work being done, vanished; and
      Kathleen and Charley were left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did not answer me in the court-room," Kathleen said. "I called to
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to hear you say them here," he rejoined. "Say what?" she asked,
      a little puzzled by the tone of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your congratulations," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out a hand to him. "I offer them now. It was wonderful. You were
      inspired. I did not think you could ever let yourself go."
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her hand firmly. "I promise not to do it again," he said
      whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I not your congratulations?" His hand drew her slightly towards him;
      she rose to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is no reason," she answered, confused, yet feeling that there was a
      double meaning in his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not allow you to be so vain," he said. "We must be companionable.
      Henceforth I shall congratulate myself&mdash;Kathleen."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking now. "Oh, what is it you are going to say to me?"
      she asked, yet not disengaging her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said it all in the court-room," he rejoined; "and you heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want me to marry you&mdash;Charley?" she asked frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you think there is no just impediment," he answered, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew her hand away, and for a moment there was a struggle in her mind&mdash;or
      heart. He knew of what she was thinking, and he did not consider it of
      serious consequence. Romance was a trivial thing, and women were prone to
      become absorbed in trivialities. When the woman had no brains, she might
      break her life upon a trifle. But Kathleen had an even mind, a serene
      temperament. Her nerves were daily cooled in a bath of nature's perfect
      health. She had never had an hour's illness in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no just or unjust impediment, Kathleen," he added presently, and
      took her hand again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked him in the eyes clearly. "You really think so?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know so," he answered. "We shall be two perfect panels in one picture
      of life."

      CHAPTER III. AFTER FIVE YEARS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "You have forgotten me?"
    </h3>
    <p>
      Charley Steele's glance was serenely non-committal as he answered drily:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot remember doing so."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other man's eyelids drew down with a look of anger, then the humour of
      the impertinence worked upon him, and he gave a nervous little laugh and
      said: "I am John Brown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'm sure my memory is not at fault," remarked Charley, with an
      outstretched hand. "My dear Brown! Still preaching little sermons?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I look it?" There was a curious glitter in John Brown's eyes. "I'm not
      preaching little sermons, and you know it well enough." He laughed, but it
      was a hard sort of mirth. "Perhaps you forgot to remember that, though,"
      he sneeringly added. "It was the work of your hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's why I should remember to forget it&mdash;I am the child of
      modesty." Charley touched the corners of his mouth with his tongue, as
      though his lips were dry, and his eyes wandered to a saloon a little
      farther down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Modesty is your curse," rejoined Brown mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once when you preached at me you said that beauty was my curse." Charley
      laughed a curt, distant little laugh which was no more the spontaneous
      humour lying for ever behind his thoughts than his eye-glass was the real
      sight of his eyes, though since childhood this laugh and his eye-glass
      were as natural to all expression of himself as John Brown's outward and
      showy frankness did not come from the real John Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Brown looked him up and down quickly, then fastened his eyes on the
      ruddy cheeks of his old friend. "Do they call you Beauty now as they used
      to?" he asked, rather insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. They only say, 'There goes Charley Steele!'" The tongue again touched
      the corners of the mouth, and the eyes wandered to the doorway down the
      street, over which was written in French: "Jean Jolicoeur, Licensed to
      sell wine, beer, and other spirituous and fermented liquors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then an archdeacon of the cathedral passed them, bowed gravely to
      Charley, glanced at John Brown, turned colour slightly, and then with a
      cold stare passed on too quickly for dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm thinking of Bunyan," said the aforetime friend of Charley Steele.
      "I'll paraphrase him and say: 'There, but for beauty and a monocle, walks
      John Brown.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the bitter sarcasm of the man, who, five years ago, had gone down at
      last beneath his agnostic raillery, Charley's blue eye did not waver, not
      a nerve stirred in his face, as he replied: "Who knows!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was what you always said&mdash;who knows! That did for John Brown."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley seemed not to hear the remark. "What are you doing now?" he asked,
      looking steadily at the face whence had gone all the warmth of manhood,
      all that courage of life which keeps men young. The lean parchment visage
      had the hunted look of the incorrigible failure, had written on it
      self-indulgence, cunning, and uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing much," John Brown replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Floated an arsenic-mine on Lake Superior."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Failed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More or less. There are hopes yet. I've kept the wolf from the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't know&mdash;nothing, perhaps; I've not the courage I had."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd have thought you might find arsenic a good thing," said Charley,
      holding out a silver cigarette-case, his eyes turning slowly from the
      startled, gloomy face of the man before him, to the cool darkness beyond
      the open doorway of that saloon on the other side of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Brown shivered&mdash;there was something so cold-blooded in the
      suggestion that he might have found arsenic a good thing. The metallic
      glare of Charley's eye-glass seemed to give an added cruelty to the words.
      Charley's monocle was the token of what was behind his blue eye-one
      ceaseless interrogation. It was that everlasting questioning, the
      ceaseless who knows! which had in the end unsettled John Brown's mind, and
      driven him at last from the church and the possible gaiters of a dean into
      the rough business of life, where he had been a failure. Yet as Brown
      looked at Charley the old fascination came on him with a rush. His hand
      suddenly caught Charley's as he took a cigarette, and he said: "Perhaps
      I'll find arsenic a good thing yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      For reply Charley laid a hand on his arm-turned him towards the shade of
      the houses opposite. Without a word they crossed the street, entered the
      saloon, and passed to a little back room, Charley giving an unsympathetic
      stare to some men at the bar who seemed inclined to speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the two passed into the small back room with the frosted door, one of
      the strangers said to the other: "What does he come here for, if he's too
      proud to speak! What's a saloon for! I'd like to smash that eye-glass for
      him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's going down-hill fast," said the other. "He drinks steady&mdash;steady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tiens&mdash;tiens!" interposed Jean Jolicoeur, the landlord. "It is not
      harm to him. He drink all day, an' he walk a crack like a bee-line."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's got the handsomest wife in this city. If I was him, I'd think more
      of myself," answered the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you think more&mdash;hein? You not come down more to my saloon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I wouldn't come to your saloon, and I wouldn't go to Theophile
      Charlemagne's shebang at the Cote Dorion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You not like Charlemagne's hotel?" said a huge black-bearded pilot,
      standing beside the landlord. "Oh, I like Charlemagne's hotel, and I like
      to talk to Suzon Charlemagne, but I'm not married, Rouge Gosselin&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he go to Charlemagne's hotel, and talk some more too mooch to dat
      Suzon Charlemagne, he will lose dat glass out of his eye," interrupted
      Rouge Gosselin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who say he been at dat place?" said Jean Jolicoeur. "He bin dere four
      times las' month, and dat Suzon Charlemagne talk'bout him ever since. When
      dat Narcisse Bovin and Jacques Gravel come down de river, he better keep
      away from dat Cote Dorion," sputtered Rouge Gosselin. "Dat's a long story
      short, all de same for you&mdash;bagosh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rouge Gosselin flung off his glass of white whiskey, and threw after it a
      glass of cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tiens! you know not M'sieu' Charley Steele," said Jean Jolicoeur, and
      turned on his heel, nodding his head sagely.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. CHARLEY MAKES A DISCOVERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      A hot day a month later Charley Steele sat in his office staring before
      him into space, and negligently smoking a cigarette. Outside there was a
      slow clacking of wheels, and a newsboy was crying "La Patrie! La Patrie!
      All about the War in France! All about the massacree!" Bells&mdash;wedding-bells&mdash;were
      ringing also, and the jubilant sounds, like the call of the newsboy, were
      out of accord with the slumberous feeling of the afternoon. Charley Steele
      turned his head slowly towards the window. The branches of a maple-tree
      half crossed it, and the leaves moved softly in the shadow they made. His
      eye went past the tree and swam into the tremulous white heat of the
      square, and beyond to where in the church-tower the bells were ringing-to
      the church doors, from which gaily dressed folk were issuing to the
      carriages, or thronged the pavement, waiting for the bride and groom to
      come forth into a new-created world&mdash;for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley looked through his monocle at the crowd reflectively, his head
      held a little to one side in a questioning sort of way, on his lips the
      ghost of a smile&mdash;not a reassuring smile. Presently he leaned forward
      slightly and the monocle dropped from his eye. He fumbled for it, raised
      it, blew on it, rubbed it with his handkerchief, and screwed it carefully
      into his eye again, his rather bushy brow gathering over it strongly, his
      look sharpened to more active thought. He stared straight across the
      square at a figure in heliotrope, whose face was turned to a man in
      scarlet uniform taller than herself two glowing figures towards whom many
      other eyes than his own were directed, some curiously, some disdain fully,
      some sadly. But Charley did not see the faces of those who looked on; he
      only saw two people&mdash;one in heliotrope, one in scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently his white firm hand went up and ran through his hair nervously,
      his comely figure settled down in the chair, his tongue touched the
      corners of his red lips, and his eyes withdrew from the woman in
      heliotrope and the man in scarlet, and loitered among the leaves of the
      tree at the window. The softness of the green, the cool health of the
      foliage, changed the look of his eye from something cold and curious to
      something companionable, and scarcely above a whisper two words came from
      his lips:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kathleen! Kathleen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      By the mere sound of the voice it would have been hard to tell what the
      words meant, for it had an inquiring cadence and yet a kind of distant
      doubt, a vague anxiety. The face conveyed nothing&mdash;it was smooth,
      fresh, and immobile. The only point where the mind and meaning of the man
      worked according to the law of his life was at the eye, where the monocle
      was caught now as in a vise. Behind this glass there was a troubled depth
      which belied the self-indulgent mouth, the egotism speaking loudly in the
      red tie, the jewelled finger, the ostentatiously simple yet sumptuous
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he drew in a sharp, sibilant breath, clicked his tongue&mdash;a
      sound of devil-may-care and hopelessness at once&mdash;and turned to a
      little cupboard behind him. The chair squeaked on the floor as he turned,
      and he frowned, shivered a little, and kicked it irritably with his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the cupboard he took a bottle of liqueur, and, pouring out a small
      glassful, drank it off eagerly. As he put the bottle away, he said again,
      in an abstracted fashion, "Kathleen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, seating himself at the table, as if with an effort towards energy,
      he rang a bell. A clerk entered. "Ask Mr. Wantage to come for a moment,"
      he said. "Mr. Wantage has gone to the church&mdash;to the wedding," was
      the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very well. He will be in again this afternoon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure to, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so. That will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk retired, and Charley, rising, unlocked a drawer, and taking out
      some books and papers, laid them on the table. Intently, carefully, he
      began to examine them, referring at the same time to a letter which had
      lain open at his hand while he had been sitting there. For a quarter of an
      hour he studied the books and papers, then, all at once, his fingers
      fastened on a point and stayed. Again he read the letter lying beside him.
      A flush crimsoned his face to his hair&mdash;a singular flush of shame, of
      embarrassment, of guilt&mdash;a guilt not his own. His breath caught in
      his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Billy!" he gasped. "Billy, by God!"
    </p>
    <p>

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. THE WOMAN IN HELIOTROPE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The flush was still on Charley's face when the door opened slowly, and a
      lady dressed in heliotrope silk entered, and came forward. Without a word
      Charley rose, and, taking a step towards her, offered a chair; at the same
      time noticing her heightened colour, and a certain rigid carriage not in
      keeping with her lithe and graceful figure. There was no mistaking the
      quiver of her upper lip&mdash;a short lip which did not hide a wonderfully
      pretty set of teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a wave of the hand she declined the seat. Glancing at the books and
      papers lying on the table, she flashed an inquiry at his flushed face,
      and, misreading the cause, with slow, quiet point, in which bitterness or
      contempt showed, she said meaningly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a slave you are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Behold the white man work!" he said good-naturedly, the flush passing
      slowly from his face. With apparent negligence he pushed the letter and
      the books and papers a little to one side, but really to place them beyond
      the range of her angry eyes. She shrugged her shoulders at his action.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For 'the fatherless children and widows, and all that are desolate and
      oppressed?'" she said, not concealing her malice, for at the wedding she
      had just left all her married life had rushed before her in a swift
      panorama, and the man in scarlet had fixed the shooting pictures in her
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a flush swept up Charley's face and seemed to blur his sight. His
      monocle dropped the length of its silken tether, and he caught it and
      slowly adjusted it again as he replied evenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You always hit the nail on the head, Kathleen." There was a kind of
      appeal in his voice, a sort of deprecation in his eye, as though he would
      be friends with her, as though, indeed, there was in his mind some secret
      pity for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her look at his face was critical and cold. It was plain that she was not
      prepared for any extra friendliness on his part&mdash;there seemed no
      reason why he should add to his usual courtesy a note of sympathy to the
      sound of her name on his lips. He had not fastened the door of the
      cupboard from which he had taken the liqueur, and it had swung open a
      little, disclosing the bottle and the glass. She saw. Her face took on a
      look of quiet hardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you not come to the wedding? She was your cousin. People asked
      where you were. You knew I was going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you need me?" he asked quietly, and his eyes involuntarily swept to
      the place where he had seen the heliotrope and scarlet make a glow of
      colour on the other side of the square. "You were not alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      She misunderstood him. Her mind had been overwrought, and she caught
      insinuation in his voice. "You mean Tom Fairing!" Her eyes blazed. "You
      are quite right&mdash;I did not need you. Tom Fairing is a man that all
      the world trusts save you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kathleen!" The words were almost a cry. "For God's sake! I have never
      thought of 'trusting' men where you are concerned. I believe in no man"&mdash;his
      voice had a sharp bitterness, though his face was smooth and unemotional&mdash;"but
      I trust you, and believe in you. Yes, upon my soul and honour, Kathleen."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke she turned quickly and stepped towards the window, an
      involuntary movement of agitation. He had touched a chord. But even as she
      reached the window and glanced down to the hot, dusty street, she heard a
      loud voice below, a reckless, ribald sort of voice, calling to some one
      to, "Come and have a drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Billy!" she said involuntarily, and looked down, then shrank back
      quickly. She turned swiftly on her husband. "Your soul and honour,
      Charley!" she said slowly. "Look at what you've made of Billy! Look at the
      company he keeps&mdash;John Brown, who hasn't even decency enough to keep
      away from the place he disgraced. Billy is always with him. You ruined
      John Brown, with your dissipation and your sneers at religion and
      your-'I-wonder-nows!' Of what use have you been, Charley? Of what use to
      anyone in the world? You think of nothing but eating, and drinking, and
      playing the fop."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced down involuntarily, and carefully flicked some cigarette-ash
      from his waistcoat. The action arrested her speech for a moment, and then,
      with a little shudder, she continued: "The best they can say of you is,
      'There goes Charley Steele!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the worst?" he asked. He was almost smiling now, for he admired her
      anger, her scorn. He knew it was deserved, and he had no idea of making
      any defence. He had said all in that instant's cry, "Kathleen!"&mdash;that
      one awakening feeling of his life so far. She had congealed the word on
      his lips by her scorn, and now he was his old debonair, dissipated self,
      with the impertinent monocle in his eye and a jest upon his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want to know the worst they say?" she asked, growing pale to the
      lips. "Go and stand behind the door of Jolicoeur's saloon. Go to any
      street corner, and listen. Do you think I don't know what they say? Do you
      think the world doesn't talk about the company you keep? Haven't I seen
      you going into Jolicoeur's saloon when I was walking on the other side of
      the street? Do you think that all the world, and I among the rest, are
      blind? Oh, you fop, you fool, you have ruined my brother, you have ruined
      my life, and I hate and despise you for a cold-blooded, selfish coward!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a deprecating gesture and stared&mdash;a look of most curious
      inquiry. They had been married for five years, and during that time they
      had never been anything but persistently courteous to each other. He had
      never on any occasion seen her face change colour, or her manner show
      chagrin or emotion. Stately and cold and polite, she had fairly met his
      ceaseless foppery and preciseness of manner. But people had said of her,
      "Poor Kathleen Steele!" for her spotless name stood sharply off from his
      negligence and dissipation. They called her "Poor Kathleen Steele!" in
      sympathy, though they knew that she had not resisted marriage with the
      well-to-do Charley Steele, while loving a poor captain in the Royal
      Fusileers. She preserved social sympathy by a perfect outward decorum,
      though the man of the scarlet coat remained in the town and haunted the
      places where she appeared, and though the eyes of the censorious world
      were watching expectantly. No voice was raised against her. Her cold
      beauty held the admiration of all women, for she was not eager for men's
      company, and she kept her poise even with the man in scarlet near her,
      glacially complacent, beautifully still, disconcertingly emotionless. They
      did not know that the poise with her was to an extent as much a pose as
      Charley's manner was to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hate you and despise you for a cold-blooded, selfish coward!" So that
      was the way Kathleen felt! Charley's tongue touched his lips quickly, for
      they were arid, and he slowly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I assure you I have not tried to influence Billy. I have no remembrance
      of his imitating me in anything. Won't you sit down? It is very fatiguing,
      this heat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley was entirely himself again. His words concerning Billy Wantage
      might have been either an impeachment of Billy's character and, by
      deduction, praise of his own, or it may have been the insufferable egoism
      of the fop, well used to imitators. The veil between the two, which for
      one sacred moment had seemed about to lift, was fallen now, leaded and
      weighted at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you would say the same about John Brown! It is disconcerting at
      least to think that we used to sit and listen to Mr. Brown as he waved his
      arms gracefully in his surplice and preached sentimental sermons. I
      suppose you will say, what we have heard you say before, that you only
      asked questions. Was that how you ruined the Rev. John Brown&mdash;and
      Billy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley was very thirsty, and because of that perhaps, his voice had an
      unusually dry tone as he replied: "I asked questions of John Brown; I
      answer them to Billy. It is I that am ruined!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was that in his voice she did not understand, for though long used
      to his paradoxical phrases and his everlasting pose&mdash;as it seemed to
      her and all the world&mdash;there now rang through his words a note she
      had never heard before. For a fleeting instant she was inclined to catch
      at some hidden meaning, but her grasp of things was uncertain. She had
      been thrown off her balance, or poise, as Charley had, for an unwonted
      second, been thrown off his pose, and her thought could not pierce beneath
      the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you will be flippant at Judgment Day," she said with a bitter
      laugh, for it seemed to her a monstrous thing that they should be such an
      infinite distance apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should one be serious then? There will be no question of an alibi, or
      evidence for the defence&mdash;no cross-examination. A cut-and-dried
      verdict!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She ignored his words. "Shall you be at home to dinner?" she rejoined
      coldly, and her eyes wandered out of the window again to that spot across
      the square where heliotrope and scarlet had met.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy not," he answered, his eyes turned away also&mdash;towards the
      cupboard containing the liqueur. "Better ask Billy; and keep him in, and
      talk to him&mdash;I really would like you to talk to him. He admires you
      so much. I wish&mdash;in fact I hope you will ask Billy to come and live
      with us," he added half abstractedly. He was trying to see his way through
      a sudden confusion of ideas. Confusion was rare to him, and his senses,
      feeling the fog, embarrassed by a sudden air of mystery and a cloud of
      futurity, were creeping to a mind-path of understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be absurd," she said coldly. "You know I won't ask him, and you
      don't want him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have always said that decision is the greatest of all qualities&mdash;even
      when the decision is bad. It saves so much worry, and tends to health."
      Suddenly he turned to the desk and opened a tin box. "Here is further
      practice for your admirable gift." He opened a paper. "I want you to sign
      off for this building&mdash;leaving it to my absolute disposal." He spread
      the paper out before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned pale and her lips tightened. She looked at him squarely in the
      eyes. "My wedding-gift!" she said. Then she shrugged her shoulders. A
      moment she hesitated, and in that moment seemed to congeal. "You need it?"
      she asked distantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He inclined his head, his eye never leaving hers. With a swift angry
      motion she caught the glove from her left hand, and, doubling it back,
      dragged it off. A smooth round ring came off with it and rolled upon the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping, he picked up the ring, and handed it back to her, saying:
      "Permit me." It was her wedding-ring. She took it with a curious
      contracted look and put it on the finger again, then pulled off the other
      glove quietly. "Of course one uses the pen with the right hand," she said
      calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Involuntary act of memory," he rejoined slowly, as she took the pen in
      her hand. "You had spoken of a wedding, this was a wedding-gift, and&mdash;that's
      right, sign there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief pause, in which she appeared to hesitate, and then she
      wrote her name in a large firm hand, and, throwing down the pen, caught up
      her gloves, and began to pull them on viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. It is very kind of you," he said. He put the document in the tin
      box, and took out another, as without a word, but with a grave face in
      which scorn and trouble were mingled, she now turned towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you spare a minute longer?" he said, and advanced towards her,
      holding the new document in his hand. "Fair exchange is no robbery. Please
      take this. No, not with the right hand; the left is better luck&mdash;the
      better the hand, the better the deed," he added with a whimsical squint
      and a low laugh, and he placed the paper in her left hand. "Item No. 2 to
      take the place of item No. 1."
    </p>
    <p>
      She scrutinised the paper. Wonder filled her face. "Why, this is a deed of
      the homestead property&mdash;worth three times as much!" she said. "Why&mdash;why
      do you do this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember that questions ruin people sometimes," he answered, and stepped
      to the door and turned the handle, as though to show her out. She was
      agitated and embarrassed now. She felt she had been unjust, and yet she
      felt that she could not say what ought to be said, if all the rules were
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," she said simply. "Did you think of this when&mdash;when you
      handed me back the ring?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never had an inspiration in my life. I was born with a plan of
      campaign."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I ought to&mdash;kiss you!" she said in some little confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might be too expensive," he answered, with a curious laugh. Then he
      added lightly: "This was a fair exchange"&mdash;he touched the papers&mdash;"but
      I should like you to bear witness, madam, that I am no robber!" He opened
      the door. Again there was that curious penetrating note in his voice, and
      that veiled look. She half hesitated, but in the pause there was a loud
      voice below and a quick foot on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Billy!" she said sharply, and passed out.

      CHAPTER VI. THE WIND AND THE SHORN LAMB
    </h2>
    <p>
      A half-hour later Charley Steele sat in his office alone with Billy
      Wantage, his brother-in-law, a tall, shapely fellow of twenty-four. Billy
      had been drinking, his face was flushed, and his whole manner was
      indolently careless and irresponsible. In spite of this, however, his grey
      eyes were nervously fixed on Charley, and his voice was shaky as he said,
      in reply to a question as to his finances: "That's my own business,
      Charley."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley took a long swallow from the tumbler of whiskey and soda beside
      him, and, as he drew some papers towards him, answered quietly: "I must
      make it mine, Billy, without a doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall youth shifted in his chair and essayed to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've never been particular about your own business. Pshaw, what's the
      use of preaching to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley pushed his chair back, and his look had just a touch of surprise,
      a hint of embarrassment. This youth, then, thought him something of a
      fool: read him by virtue of his ornamentations, his outer idiosyncrasy!
      This boy, whose iniquity was under his finger on that table, despised him
      for his follies, and believed in him less than his wife&mdash;two people
      who had lived closer to him than any others in the world. Before he
      answered he lifted the glass beside him and drank to the last drop, then
      slowly set it down and said, with a dangerous smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have always been particular about other people's finances, and the
      statement that you haven't isn't preaching, it's an indictment&mdash;so it
      is, Billy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An indictment!" Billy bit his finger-nails now, and his voice shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what the jury would say, and the judge would do the preaching. You
      have stolen twenty-five thousand dollars of trust-moneys!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was absolute silence in the room. From outside in the
      square came the Marche-t'en! of a driver, and the loud cackling laugh of
      some loafer at the corner. Charley's look imprisoned his brother-in-law,
      and Billy's eyes were fixed in a helpless stare on Charley's finger, which
      held like a nail the record of his infamy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy drew himself back with a jerk of recovery, and said with bravado,
      but with fear in look and motion: "Don't stare like that. The thing's
      done, and you can't undo it, and that's all there is about it." Charley
      had been staring at the youth-staring and not seeing him really, but
      seeing his wife and watching her lips say again: "You are ruining Billy!"
      He was not sober, but his mind was alert, his eccentric soul was getting
      kaleidoscopic glances at strange facts of life as they rushed past his
      mind into a painful red obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, it can be undone, and it's not all there is about it!" he
      answered quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up suddenly, went to the door, locked it, put the key in his
      pocket, and, coming back, sat down again beside the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy watched him with shrewd, hunted eyes. What did Charley mean to do?
      To give him in charge? To send him to jail? To shut him out from the world
      where he had enjoyed himself so much for years and years? Never to go
      forth free among his fellows! Never to play the gallant with all the
      pretty girls he knew! Never to have any sports, or games, or tobacco, or
      good meals, or canoeing in summer, or tobogganing in winter, or
      moose-hunting, or any sort of philandering!
    </p>
    <p>
      The thoughts that filled his mind now were not those of regret for his
      crime, but the fears of the materialist and sentimentalist, who revolted
      at punishment and all the shame and deprivation it would involve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do with the money?" said Charley, after a minute's silence,
      in which two minds had travelled far.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I put it into mines."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What mines?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out on Lake Superior."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of mines?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arsenic."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley's eye-glass dropped, and rattled against the gold button of his
      white waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In arsenic-mines!" He put the monocle to his eye again. "On whose
      advice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "John Brown's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "John Brown's!" Charley Steele's ideas were suddenly shaken and scattered
      by a man's name, as a bolting horse will crumple into confusion a crowd of
      people. So this was the way his John Brown had come home to roost. He
      lifted the empty whiskey-glass to his lips and drained air. He was
      terribly thirsty; he needed something to pull himself together. Five years
      of dissipation had not robbed him of his splendid native ability, but it
      had, as it were, broken the continuity of his will and the sequence of his
      intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not investment?" he asked, his tongue thick and hot in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. What would have been the good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Speculation&mdash;you bought heavily to sell on an expected
      rise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so even in Charley's manner and tone that Billy
      misinterpreted it. It seemed hopeful that Charley was going to make the
      best of a bad job.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," Billy said eagerly, "it seemed dead certain. He showed me the
      way the thing was being done, the way the company was being floated, how
      the market in New York was catching hold. It looked splendid. I thought I
      could use the money for a week or so, then put it back, and have a nice
      little scoop, at no one's cost. I thought it was a dead-sure thing&mdash;and
      I was hard up, and Kathleen wouldn't lend me any more. If Kathleen had
      only done the decent thing&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden flush of anger swept over Charley's face&mdash;never before in
      his life had that face been so sensitive, never even as a child. Something
      had waked in the odd soul of Beauty Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be a sweep&mdash;leave Kathleen out of it!" he said, in a sharp,
      querulous voice&mdash;a voice unnatural to himself, suggestive of little
      use, as though he were learning to speak, using strange words stumblingly
      through a melee of the emotions. It was not the voice of Charley Steele
      the fop, the poseur, the idlest man in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What part of the twenty-five thousand went into the arsenic?" he said,
      after a pause. There was no feeling in the voice now; it was again even
      and inquiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't lie. You've been living freely. Tell the truth, or&mdash;or I'll
      know the reason why, Billy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About two-thirds-that's the truth. I had debts, and I paid them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you bet on the races?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And lost?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. See here, Charley; it was the most awful luck&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, for the fatherless children and widows, and all that are oppressed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley's look again went through and beyond the culprit, and he recalled
      his wife's words and his own reply. A quick contempt and a sort of
      meditative sarcasm were in the tone. It was curious, too, that he could
      smile, but the smile did not encourage Billy Wantage now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all gone, I suppose?" he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All but about a hundred dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you have had your game; now you must pay for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy had imagination, and he was melodramatic. He felt danger ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go and shoot myself!" he said, banging the table with his fist so
      that the whiskey-tumbler shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was hardly prepared for what followed. Charley's nerves had been
      irritated; his teeth were on edge. This threat, made in such a cheap,
      insincere way, was the last thing in the world he could bear to hear. He
      knew that Billy lied; that if there was one thing Billy would not do,
      shooting himself was that one thing. His own life was very sweet to Billy
      Wantage. Charley hated him the more at that moment because he was
      Kathleen's brother. For if there was one thing he knew of Kathleen, it was
      that she could not do a mean thing. Cold, unsympathetic she might be,
      cruel at a pinch perhaps, but dishonourable&mdash;never! This weak,
      cowardly youth was her brother! No one had ever seen such a look on
      Charley Steele's face as came upon it now&mdash;malicious, vindictive. He
      stooped over Billy in a fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think I'm a fool and an ass&mdash;you ignorant, brainless, lying cub!
      You make me a thief before all the world by forging my name, and stealing
      the money for which I am responsible, and then you rate me so low that you
      think you'll bamboozle me by threats of suicide. You haven't the courage
      to shoot yourself&mdash;drunk or sober. And what do you think would be
      gained by it? Eh, what do you think would be gained? You can't see that
      you'd insult your sister as well as&mdash;as rob me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy Wantage cowered. This was not the Charley Steele he had known, not
      like the man he had seen since a child. There was something almost uncouth
      in this harsh high voice, these gauche words, this raw accent; but it was
      powerful and vengeful, and it was full of purpose. Billy quivered, yet his
      adroit senses caught at a straw in the words, "as rob me!" Charley was
      counting it a robbery of himself, not of the widows and orphans! That gave
      him a ray of hope. In a paroxysm of fear, joined to emotional excitement,
      he fell upon his knees, and pleaded for mercy&mdash;for the sake of one
      chance in life, for the family name, for Kathleen's sake, for the sake of
      everything he had ruthlessly dishonoured. Tears came readily to his eyes,
      real tears&mdash;of excitement; but he could measure, too, the strength of
      his appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'll stand by me in this, I'll pay you back every cent, Charley," he
      cried. "I will, upon my soul and honour! You shan't lose a penny, if
      you'll only see me through. I'll work my fingers off to pay it back till
      the last hour of my life. I'll be straight till the day I die&mdash;so
      help me God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley's eyes wandered to the cupboard where the liqueurs were. If he
      could only decently take a drink! But how could he with this boy kneeling
      before him? His breath scorched his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get up!" he said shortly. "I'll see what I can do&mdash;to-morrow. Go
      away home. Don't go out again to-night. And come here at ten o'clock in
      the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy took up his hat, straightened his tie, carefully brushed the dust
      from his knees, and, seizing Charley's hand, said: "You're the best fellow
      in the world, Charley." He went towards the door, dusting his face of
      emotion as he had dusted his knees. The old selfish, shrewd look was again
      in his eyes. Charley's gaze followed him gloomily. Billy turned the handle
      of the door. It was locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley came forward and unlocked it. As Billy passed through, Charley,
      looking sharply in his face, said hoarsely: "By Heaven, I believe you're
      not worth it!" Then he shut the door again and locked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He almost ran back and opened the cupboard. Taking out the bottle of
      liqueur, he filled a glass and drank it off. Three times he did this, then
      seated himself at the table with a sigh of relief and no emotion in his
      face.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. "PEACE, PEACE, AND THERE IS NO PEACE"'
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sun was setting by the time Charley was ready to leave his office.
      Never in his life had he stayed so late in "the halls of industry," as he
      flippantly called his place of business. The few cases he had won so
      brilliantly since the beginning of his career, he had studied at night in
      his luxurious bedroom in the white brick house among the maples on the
      hill. In every case, as at the trial of Joseph Nadeau, the man who
      murdered the timber-merchant, the first prejudice of judge and jury had
      given way slowly before the deep-seeing mind, which had as rare a power of
      analysis as for generalisation, and reduced masses of evidence to phrases;
      and verdicts had been given against all personal prejudice&mdash;to be
      followed outside the court by the old prejudice, the old look askance at
      the man called Beauty Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him it had made no difference at any time. He cared for neither praise
      nor blame. In his actions a materialist, in his mind he was a watcher of
      life, a baffled inquirer whose refuge was irony, and whose singular habits
      had in five years become a personal insult to the standards polite society
      and Puritan morality had set up. Perhaps the insult had been intended, for
      irregularities were committed with an insolent disdain for appearances. He
      did nothing secretly; his page of life was for him who cared to read. He
      played cards, he talked agnosticism, he went on shooting expeditions which
      became orgies, he drank openly in saloons, he whose forefathers had been
      gentlemen of King George, and who sacrificed all in the great American
      revolution for honour and loyalty&mdash;statesmen, writers, politicians,
      from whom he had direct inheritance, through stirring, strengthening
      forces, in the building up of laws and civilisation in a new land. Why he
      chose to be what he was&mdash;if he did choose&mdash;he alone could
      answer. His personality had impressed itself upon his world, first by its
      idiosyncrasies and afterwards by its enigmatical excesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was he thinking of as he laid the papers away in the tin box in a
      drawer, locked it, and put the key in his pocket? He had found to the
      smallest detail Billy's iniquity, and he was now ready to shoulder the
      responsibility, to save the man, who, he knew, was scarce worth the
      saving. But Kathleen&mdash;there was what gave him pause. As he turned to
      the window and looked out over the square he shuddered. He thought of the
      exchange of documents he had made with her that day, and he had a sense of
      satisfaction. This defalcation of Billy's would cripple him, for money had
      flown these last few years. He had had heavy losses, and he had dug deep
      into his capital. Down past the square ran a cool avenue of beeches to the
      water, and he could see his yacht at anchor. On the other side of the
      water, far down the shore, was a house which had been begun as a summer
      cottage, and had ended in being a mansion. A few Moorish pillars, brought
      from Algiers for the decoration of the entrance, had necessitated the
      raising of the roof, and then all had to be in proportion, and the cottage
      became like an appanage to a palace. So it had gone, and he had cared so
      little about it all, and for the consequences. He had this day secured
      Kathleen from absolute poverty, no matter what happened, and that had its
      comfort. His eyes wandered among the trees. He could see the yellow
      feathers of the oriole and catch the note of the whippoorwill, and from
      the great church near the voices of the choir came over. He could hear the
      words "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to
      thy word."
    </p>
    <p>
      Depart in peace&mdash;how much peace was there in the world? Who had it?
      The remembrance of what Kathleen said to him at the door&mdash;"I suppose
      I ought to kiss you"&mdash;came to him, was like a refrain in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace is the penalty of silence and inaction," he said to himself
      meditatively. "Where there is action there is no peace. If the brain and
      body fatten, then there is peace. Kathleen and I have lived at peace, I
      suppose. I never said a word to her that mightn't be put down in large
      type and pasted on my tombstone, and she never said a word to me&mdash;till
      to-day&mdash;that wasn't like a water-colour picture. Not till to-day, in
      a moment's strife and trouble, did I ever get near her. And we've lived in
      peace. Peace? Where is the right kind of peace? Over there is old Sainton.
      He married a rich woman, he has had the platter of plenty before him
      always, he wears ribbons and such like baubles given by the Queen, but his
      son had to flee the country. There's Herring. He doesn't sleep because his
      daughter is going to marry an Italian count. There's Latouche. His place
      in the cabinet is begotten in corruption, in the hotbed of faction war.
      There's Kenealy. His wife has led him a dance of deep damnation. There's
      the lot of them&mdash;every one, not an ounce of peace among them, except
      with old Casson, who weighs eighteen stone, lives like a pig, grows
      stuffier in mind and body every day, and drinks half a bottle of whiskey
      every night. There's no one else&mdash;yes, there is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at a small black-robed figure with clean-shaven face, white
      hair, and shovel-hat, who passed slowly along the wooden walk beneath,
      with meditative content in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's peace," he said with a laugh. "I've known Father Hallon for
      twenty-five years, and no man ever worked so hard, ever saw more trouble,
      ever shared other people's bad luck mere than he; ever took the bit in his
      teeth, when it was a matter of duty, stronger than he; and yet there's
      peace; he has it; a peace that passes all understanding&mdash;mine anyhow.
      I've never had a minute's real peace. The World, or Nature, or God, or It,
      whatever the name is, owes me peace. And how is It to give it? Why, by
      answering my questions. Now it's a curious thing that the only person I
      ever met who could answer any questions of mine&mdash;answer them in the
      way that satisfies&mdash;is Suzon. She works things down to phrases. She
      has wisdom in the raw, and a real grip on life, and yet all the men she
      has known have been river-drivers and farmers, and a few men from town who
      mistook the sort of Suzon she is. Virtuous and straight, she's a born
      child of Aphrodite too&mdash;by nature. She was made for love. A thousand
      years ago she would have had a thousand loves! And she thinks the world is
      a magnificent place, and she loves it, and wallows&mdash;fairly wallows&mdash;in
      content. Now which is right: Suzon or Father Hallon&mdash;Aphrodite or the
      Nazarene? Which is peace&mdash;as the bird and the beast of the field get
      it&mdash;the fallow futile content, or&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly stopped, hiccoughed, then hurriedly drawing paper before him,
      he sat down. For an hour he wrote. It grew darker. He pushed the table
      nearer the window, and the singing of the choir in the church came in upon
      him as his pen seemed to etch words into the paper, firm, eccentric,
      meaning. What he wrote that evening has been preserved, and the yellow
      sheets lie loosely in a black despatch-box which contains the few records
      Charley Steele left behind him. What he wrote that night was the note of
      his mind, the key to all those strange events through which he began to
      move two hours after the lines were written:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        Over thy face is a veil of white sea-mist,
        Only thine eyes shine like stars; bless or blight me,
        I will hold close to the leash at thy wrist,
        O Aphrodite!

        Thou in the East and I here in the West,
        Under our newer skies purple and pleasant:
        Who shall decide which is better&mdash;attest,
        Saga or peasant?

        Thou with Serapis, Osiris, and Isis,
        I with Jehovah, in vapours and shadows;
        Thou with the gods' joy-enhancing devices,
        Sweet-smelling meadows!

        What is there given us?&mdash;Food and some raiment,
        Toiling to reach to some Patmian haven,
        Giving up all for uncertain repayment,
        Feeding the raven!

        Striving to peer through the infinite azure,
        Alternate turning to earthward and falling,
        Measuring life with Damastian measure,
        Finite, appalling.

        What does it matter! They passed who with Homer
        Poured out the wine at the feet of their idols:
        Passing, what found they? To-come a misnomer,
        It and their idols?

        Sacristan, acolyte, player, or preacher,
        Each to his office, but who holds the key?
        Death, only Death&mdash;thou, the ultimate teacher
        Wilt show it to me.

        And when the forts and the barriers fall,
        Shall we then find One the true, the almighty,
        Wisely to speak with the worst of us all&mdash;
        Ah, Aphrodite!

        Waiting, I turn from the futile, the human,
        Gone is the life of me, laughing with youth
        Steals to learn all in the face of a woman,
        Mendicant Truth!
</pre>
    <p>
      Rising with a bitter laugh, and murmuring the last lines, he thrust the
      papers into a drawer, locked it, and going quickly from the room, he went
      down-stairs. His horse and cart were waiting for him, and he got in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The groom looked at him inquiringly. "The Cote Dorion!" he said, and they
      sped away through the night.

      CHAPTER VIII. THE COST OF THE ORNAMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      One, two, three, four, five, six miles. The sharp click of the iron hoofs
      on the road; the strong rush of the river; the sweet smell of the maple
      and the pungent balsam; the dank rich odour of the cedar swamp; the cry of
      the loon from the water; the flaming crane in the fishing-boat; the
      fisherman, spear in hand, staring into the dark waters tinged with sombre
      red; the voice of a lonely settler keeping time to the ping of the axe as,
      lengthening out his day to nightly weariness, he felled a tree;
      river-drivers' camps spotted along the shore; huge cribs or rafts which
      had swung down the great stream for scores of miles, the immense oars
      motionless, the little houses on the timbers blinking with light; and from
      cheerful raftsmen coming the old familiar song of the rivers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "En roulant, ma boule roulant,
          En roulant ma boule!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Not once had Charley Steele turned his head as the horse sped on. His face
      was kept straight along the line of the road; he seemed not to see or to
      hear, to be unresponsive to sound or scene. The monocle at his eye was
      like a veil to hide the soul, a defence against inquiry, itself the
      unceasing question, a sort of battery thrown forward, a kind of
      field-casemate for a lonely besieged spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was full of suggestion. It might have been the glass behind which
      showed some mediaeval relic, the body of some ancient Egyptian king whose
      life had been spent in doing wonders and making signs&mdash;the primitive,
      anthropomorphic being. He might have been a stone man, for any motion that
      he made. Yet looking at him closely you would have seen discontent in the
      eye, a kind of glaze of the sardonic over the whole face.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the good! the face asked. What is there worth doing? it said. What
      a limitless futility! it urged, fain to be contradicted too, as the grim
      melancholy of the figure suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be an animal and soak in the world," he thought to himself&mdash;"that
      is natural; and the unnatural is civilisation, and the cheap adventure of
      the mind into fields of baffling speculation, lighted by the flickering
      intelligences of dead speculators, whose seats we have bought in the
      stock-exchange of mortality, and exhaust our lives in paying for. To eat,
      to drink, to lie fallow, indifferent to what comes after, to roam like the
      deer, and to fight like the tiger&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to a dead stop in his thinking. "To fight like the tiger!" He
      turned his head quickly now to where upon a raft some river-drivers were
      singing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "And when a man in the fight goes down,
        Why, we will carry him home!"
</pre>
    <p>
      "To fight like the tiger!" Ravage&mdash;the struggle to possess from all
      the world what one wished for one's self, and to do it without mercy and
      without fear-that was the clear plan in the primitive world, where action
      was more than speech and dominance than knowledge. Was not civilisation a
      mistake, and religion the insinuating delusion designed to cover it up;
      or, if not designed, accepted by the original few who saw that humanity
      could not turn back, and must even go forward with illusions, lest in mere
      despair all men died and the world died with them?
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes wandered to the raft where the men were singing, and he
      remembered the threat made: that if he came again to the Cote Dorion he
      "would get what for!" He remembered the warning of Rouge Gosselin conveyed
      by Jolicoeur, and a sinister smile crossed over his face. The
      contradictions of his own thoughts came home to him suddenly, for was it
      not the case that his physical strength alone, no matter what his skill,
      would be of small service to him in a dark corner of contest? Primitive
      ideas could only hold in a primitive world. His real weapon was his brain,
      that which civilisation had given him in lieu of primitive prowess and the
      giant's strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come to a long piece of corduroy-road, and the horse's hoofs
      struck rumbling hollow sounds from the floor of cedar logs. There was a
      swamp on one side where fire-flies were flickering, and there flashed into
      Charley Steele's mind some verses he had once learned at school:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "They made her a grave too cold and damp
        For a soul so warm and true&mdash;"
</pre>
    <p>
      It kept repeating itself in his brain in a strange dreary monotone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop the horse. I'll walk the rest of the way," he said presently to the
      groom. "You needn't come for me, Finn; I'll walk back as far as the
      Marochal Tavern. At twelve sharp I'll be there. Give yourself a drink and
      some supper"&mdash;he put a dollar into the man's hand&mdash;"and no white
      whiskey, mind: a bottle of beer and a leg of mutton, that's the thing." He
      nodded his head, and by the light of the moon walked away smartly down the
      corduroy-road through the shadows of the swamp. Finn the groom looked
      after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if he ain't a queer dick! A reg'lar 'centric&mdash;but a reg'lar
      brick, cutting a wide swathe as he goes. He's a tip-topper; and he's a
      sort of tough too&mdash;a sort of a kind of a tough. Well, it's none of my
      business. Get up!" he added to the horse, and turning round in the road
      with difficulty, he drove back a mile to the Tavern Marochal for his beer
      and mutton&mdash;and white whiskey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley stepped on briskly, his shining leather shoes, straw hat, and
      light cane in no good keeping with his surroundings. He was thinking that
      he had never been in such a mood for talk with Suzon Charlemagne.
      Charlemagne's tavern of the Cote Dorion was known over half a province,
      and its patrons carried news of it half across a continent. Suzon
      Charlemagne&mdash;a girl of the people, a tavern-girl, a friend of
      sulking, coarse river-drivers! But she had an alert precision of brain, an
      instinct that clove through wastes of mental underbrush to the tree of
      knowledge. Her mental sight was as keen and accurate as that which runs
      along the rifle-barrel of the great hunter with the red deer in view.
      Suzon Charlemagne no company for Charley Steele? What did it matter! He
      had entered into other people's lives to-day, had played their games with
      them and for them, and now he would play his own game, live his own life
      in his own way through the rest of this day. He thirsted for some sort of
      combat, for the sharp contrasts of life, for the common and the base; he
      thirsted even for the white whiskey against which he had warned his groom.
      He was reckless&mdash;not blindly, but wilfully, wildly reckless, caring
      not at all what fate or penalty might come his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do I care!" he said to himself. "I shall never squeal at any
      penalty. I shall never say in the great round-up that I was weak and I
      fell. I'll take my gruel expecting it, not fearing it&mdash;if there is to
      be any gruel anywhere, or any round-up anywhere!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A figure suddenly appeared coming round the bend of the road before him.
      It was Rouge Gosselin. Rouge Gosselin was inclined to speak. Some satanic
      whim or malicious foppery made Charley stare him blankly in the face. The
      monocle and the stare stopped the bon soir and the friendly warning on
      Rouge Gosselin's tongue, and the pilot passed on with a muttered oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gosselin had not gone far, however, before he suddenly stopped and laughed
      outright, for at the bottom he had great good-nature, in keeping with his
      "six-foot" height, and his temper was friendly if quick. It seemed so
      absurd, so audacious, that a man could act like Charley Steele, that he at
      once became interested in the phenomenon, and followed slowly after
      Charley, saying as he went: "Tiens, there will be things to watch
      to-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Charley was within five hundred yards of the tavern he could hear
      the laughter and song coming from the old seigneury which Theophile
      Charlemagne called now the Cote Dorion Hotel, after the name given to the
      point on which the house stood. Low and wide-roofed, with dormer windows
      and a wide stoop in front, and walls three feet thick, behind, on the
      river side, it hung over the water, its narrow veranda supported by piles,
      with steps down to the water-side. Seldom was there an hour when boats
      were not tied to these steps. Summer and winter the tavern was a place of
      resort. Inside, the low ceiling, the broad rafters, the great fireplace,
      the well-worn floor, the deep windows, the wooden cross let into the wall,
      and the varied and picturesque humanity frequenting this great room, gave
      it an air of romance. Yet there were people who called the tavern a
      "shebang"&mdash;slander as it was against Suzon Charlemagne, which every
      river-driver and woodsman and habitant who frequented the place would have
      resented with violence. It was because they thought Charley Steele
      slandered the girl and the place in his mind, that the river-drivers had
      sworn they would make it hot for him if he came again. Charley was the
      last man in the world to undeceive them by words.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he coolly walked into the great room, where a half-dozen of them were
      already assembled, drinking white "whiskey-wine," he had no intention of
      setting himself right. He raised his hat cavalierly to Suzon and shook
      hands with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took no notice of the men around him. "Brandy, please!" he said. "Why
      do I drink, do you say?" he added, as Suzon placed the bottle and glass
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for an instant, then she said gravely: "Perhaps because you
      like it; perhaps because something was left out of you when you were made,
      and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused and went no further, for a red-shirted river-driver with brass
      rings in his ears came close to them, and called gruffly for whiskey. He
      glowered at Charley, who looked at him indolently, then raised his glass
      towards Suzon and drank the brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pish!" said Red Shirt, and, turning round, joined his comrades. It was
      clear he wanted a pretext to quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps because you like it; perhaps because something was left out of
      you when you were made&mdash;" Charley smiled pleasantly as Suzon came
      over to him again. "You've answered the question," he said, "and struck
      the thing at the centre. Which is it? The difficulty to decide which has
      divided the world. If it's only a physical craving, it means that we are
      materialists naturally, and that the soil from which the grape came is the
      soil that's in us; that it is the body feeding on itself all the time;
      that like returns to like, and we live a little together, and then mould
      together for ever and ever, amen. If it isn't a natural craving&mdash;like
      to like&mdash;it's a proof of immortality, for it represents the wild wish
      to forget the world, to be in another medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am only myself when I am drunk. Liquor makes me human. At other times
      I'm merely Charley Steele! Now isn't it funny, this sort of talk here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know about that," she answered, "if, as you say, it's natural.
      This tavern's the only place I have to think in, and what seems to you
      funny is a sort of ordinary fact to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right again, ma belle Suzon. Nothing's incongruous. I've never felt so
      much like singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs as when I've been
      drinking. I remember the last time I was squiffy I sang all the way home
      that old nursery hymn:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         "'On the other side of Jordan,
          In the sweet fields of Eden,
          Where the tree of life is blooming,
             There is rest for you.
          There is rest for the weary,
          There is rest for the weary,
          There is rest for the weary,
             There is rest for you!'"
</pre>
    <p>
      "I should have liked to hear you sing it&mdash;sure!" said Suzon,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley tossed off a quarter-tumbler of brandy, which, instead of flushing
      the face, seemed only to deepen the whiteness of the skin, showing up more
      brightly the spots of colour in the cheeks, that white and red which had
      made him known as Beauty Steele. With a whimsical humour, behind which was
      the natural disposition of the man to do what he listed without thinking
      of the consequences, he suddenly began singing, in a voice shaken a little
      now by drink, but full of a curious magnetism:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "On the other side of Jordan&mdash;"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't; please don't!" said the girl, in fear, for she saw two
      river-drivers entering the door, one of whom had sworn he would do for
      Charley Steele if ever he crossed his path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't&mdash;M'sieu' Charley!" she again urged. The "Charley" caught
      his ear, and the daring in his eye brightened still more. He was ready for
      any change or chance to-night, was standing on the verge of any adventure,
      the most reckless soul in Christendom.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "On the other side of Jordan,
          In the sweet fields of Eden,
          Where the tree of life is blooming,
             There is rest for you!"
</pre>
    <p>
      What more incongruous thing than this flaneur in patent leathers and red
      tie, this "hell-of-a-fellow with a pane of glass in his eye," as Jake
      Hough, the horse-doctor, afterwards said, surrounded by red and
      blue-shirted river-men, woodsmen, loafers, and toughs, singing a sacred
      song with all the unction of a choir-boy; with a magnetism, too, that did
      its work in spite of all prejudice? It was as if he were counsel in one of
      those cases when, the minds and sympathies of judge and jury at first
      arrayed against him, he had irresistibly cloven his way to their judgment&mdash;not
      stealing away their hearts, but governing, dominating their intelligences.
      Whenever he had done this he had been drinking hard, was in a mental world
      created by drink, serene, clear-eyed, in which his brain worked like an
      invincible machine, perfect and powerful. Was it the case that, as he
      himself suggested, he was never so natural as when under this influence?
      That then and only then the real man spoke, that then and only then the
      primitive soul awakened, that it supplied the thing left out of him at
      birth?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "There is rest for the weary,
          There is rest for the weary,
          There is rest for the weary,
             There is rest for you!"
</pre>
    <p>
      One, two verses he sang as the men, at first snorting and scornful,
      shuffled angrily; then Jake Hough, the English horse-doctor, roared in the
      refrain:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "There is rest for the weary,
             There is rest for you!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Upon which, carried away, every one of them roared, gurgled, or shouted
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "There is rest for the weary,
             There is rest for you!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Rouge Gosselin, who had entered during the singing, now spoke up quickly
      in French:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sermon now, M'sieu'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley took his monocle out of his eye and put it back again. Now each
      man present seemed singled out for an attack by this little battery of
      glass. He did not reply directly to Rouge Gosselin, but standing perfectly
      still, with one hand resting on the counter at which Suzon stood, he
      prepared to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suzon did not attempt to stop him now, but gazed at him in a sort of awe.
      These men present were Catholics, and held religion in superstitious
      respect, however far from practising its precepts. Many of them had been
      profane and blasphemous in their time; may have sworn "sacre bapteme!" one
      of the worst oaths of their race; but it had been done in the wildness of
      anger, and they were little likely to endure from Charley Steele any word
      that sounded like blasphemy. Besides, the world said that he was an
      infidel, and that was enough for bitter prejudice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pause&mdash;very short&mdash;before Charley began speaking, Suzon's
      fingers stole to his on the counter and pressed them quickly. He made no
      response; he was scarcely aware of it. He was in a kind of dream. In an
      even, conversational tone, in French at once idiomatic and very simple, he
      began:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear friends, this is a world where men get tired. If they work they
      get tired, and if they play they get tired. If they look straight ahead of
      them they walk straight, but then they get blind by-and-by; if they look
      round them and get open-eyed, their feet stumble and they fall. It is a
      world of contradictions. If a man drinks much he loses his head, and if he
      doesn't drink at all he loses heart. If he asks questions he gets into
      trouble, and if he doesn't ask them he gets old before his time. Take the
      hymn we have just sung:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "'On the other side of Jordan,
          In the sweet fields of Eden,
          Where the tree of life is blooming,
             There is rest for you!'
</pre>
    <p>
      "We all like that, because we get tired, and it isn't always summer, and
      nothing blooms all the year round. We get up early and we work late, and
      we sleep hard, and when the weather is good and wages good, and there's
      plenty in the house, we stay sober and we sadly sing, 'On the other side
      of Jordan'; but when the weather's heavy and funds scarce, and the pork
      and molasses and bread come hard, we get drunk, and we sing the comic
      chanson 'Brigadier, vows avez raison!' We've been singing a sad song
      to-night when we're feeling happy. We didn't think whether it was sad or
      not, we only knew it pleased our ears, and we wanted those sweet fields of
      Eden, and the blooming tree of life, and the rest under the tree. But ask
      a question or two. Where is the other side of Jordan? Do you go up to it,
      or down to it? And how do you go? And those sweet fields of Eden, what do
      they look like, and how many will they hold? Isn't it clear that the
      things that make us happiest in this world are the things we go for
      blind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused. Now a dozen men came a step or two nearer, and crowded close
      together, looking over each others' shoulders at him with sharp, wondering
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that so?" he continued. "Do you realise that no man knows where
      that Jordan and those fields are, and what the flower of the tree of life
      looks like? Let us ask a question again. Why is it that the one being in
      all the world who could tell us anything about it, the one being who had
      ever seen Jordan or Eden or that tree of life-in fact, the one of all
      creation who could describe heaven, never told? Isn't it queer? Here he
      was&mdash;that one man-standing just as I am among you, and round him were
      the men who followed him, all ordinary men, with ordinary curiosity. And
      he said he had come down from heaven, and for years they were with him,
      and yet they never asked him what that heaven was like: what it looked
      like, what it felt like, what sort of life they lived there, what manner
      of folk were the angels, what was the appearance of God. Why didn't they
      ask, and why didn't he answer? People must have kept asking that question
      afterwards, for a man called John answered it. He described, as only an
      oriental Jew would or could, a place all precious stones and gold and
      jewels and candles, in oriental language very splendid and auriferous. But
      why didn't those twelve men ask the One Man who knew, and why didn't the
      One answer? And why didn't the One tell without being asked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused again, and now there came a shuffling and a murmuring, a curious
      rumble, a hard breathing, for Charley had touched with steely finger the
      tender places in the natures of these Catholics, who, whatever their
      lives, held fast to the immemorial form, the sacredness of Mother Church.
      They were ever ready to step into the galley which should bear them all
      home, with the invisible rowers of God at the oars, down the wild rapids,
      to the haven of St. Peter. There was savagery in their faces now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw, and he could not refrain from smiling as he stretched out his hand
      to them again with a little quieting gesture, and continued soothingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should we ask? There's a thing called electricity. Well, you know
      that if you take a slice out of anything, less remains behind. We can take
      the air out of this room, and scarcely leave any in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We take a drink out of a bottle, and certainly there isn't as much left
      in it! But the queer thing is that with this electricity you take it away
      and just as much remains. It goes out from your toe, rushes away to
      Timbuctoo, and is back in your toe before you can wink. Why? No one knows.
      What's the good of asking? You can't see it: you can only see what it
      does. What good would it do us if we knew all about it? There it is, and
      it's going to revolutionise the world. It's no good asking&mdash;no one
      knows what it is and where it comes from, or what it looks like. It's
      better to go it blind, because you feel the power, though you can't see
      where it comes from. You can't tell where the fields of Eden are, but you
      believe they're somewhere, and that you'll get to them some day. So say
      your prayers, believe all you can, don't ask questions, and don't try to
      answer 'em; and remember that Charley Steele preached to you the fear of
      the Lord at the Cote Dorion, and wound up the service with the fine old
      hymn:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'I'll away, I'll away, to the promised land&mdash;'"
</pre>
    <p>
      A whole verse of this camp-meeting hymn he sang in an ominous silence now,
      for it had crept into their minds that the hymn they had previously sung
      so loudly was a Protestant hymn, and that this was another Protestant hymn
      of the rankest sort. When he stopped singing and pushed over his glass for
      Suzon to fill it, the crowd were noiseless and silent for a moment, for
      the spell was still on them. They did not recover themselves until they
      saw him lift his glass to Suzon, his back on them, again insolently
      oblivious of them all. They could not see his face, but they could see the
      face of Suzon Charlemagne, and they misunderstood the light in her eye,
      the flush on her cheek. They set it down to a personal interest in Charley
      Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley had, however, thrown a spell over her in another fashion. In her
      eye, in her face, was admiration, the sympathy of a strong intelligence,
      the wonder of a mind in the presence of its master, but they thought they
      saw passion, love, desire, in her face&mdash;in the face of their Suzon,
      the pride of the river, the flower of the Cote Dorion. Not alone because
      Charley had blasphemed against religion did they hate him at this moment,
      but because every heart was scorched with envy and jealousy&mdash;the
      black unreasoning jealousy which the unlettered, the dull, the crude,
      feels for the lettered, the able and the outwardly refined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley was back again in the unfriendly climate of his natural life.
      Suzon felt the troubled air round them, saw the dark looks on the faces of
      the men, and was at once afraid and elated. She loved the glow of
      excitement, she had a keen sense of danger, but she also felt that in any
      possible trouble to-night the chances of escape would be small for the man
      before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed out his glass again. She mechanically poured brandy into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've had more than enough," she said, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every man knows his own capacity, Suzon. Love me little, love me long,"
      he added, again raising his glass to her, as the men behind suddenly moved
      forward upon the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't&mdash;for God's sake!" she whispered hastily. "Do go&mdash;or
      there'll be trouble!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The black face of Theophile Charlemagne was also turned anxiously in
      Charley's direction as he pushed out glasses for those who called for
      liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do, do go&mdash;like a good soul!" Suzon urged. Charley laughed
      disdainfully. "Like a good soul!" Had it come to this, that Suzon pleaded
      with him as if he were a foolish, obstreperous child!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faithless and unbelieving!" he said to Suzon in English. "Didn't I play
      my game well a minute ago&mdash;eh&mdash;eh&mdash;eh, Suzon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, yes, M'sieu'," she replied in English; "but now you are
      differen' and so are they. You must goah, so, you must!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again, a queer sardonic sort of laugh, yet he put out his hand
      and touched the girl's arm lightly with a forefinger. "I am a Quaker born;
      I never stir till the spirit moves me," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scented conflict, and his spirits rose at the thought. Some reckless
      demon of adventure possessed him; some fatalistic courage was upon him. So
      far as the eye could see, the liquor he had drunk had done no more than
      darken the blue of his eye, for his hand was steady, his body was well
      poised, his look was direct; there seemed some strange electric force in
      leash behind his face, a watchful yet nonchalant energy of spirit, joined
      to an indolent pose of body. As the girl looked at him something of his
      unreckoning courage passed into her. Somehow she believed in him, felt
      that by some wild chance he might again conquer this truculent element now
      almost surrounding him. She spoke quickly to her step-father. "He won't
      go. What can we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go, and he'll follow," said Theophile, who didn't want a row&mdash;a
      dangerous row-in his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he won't," she said; "and I don't believe they'd let him follow me."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time to say more. The crowd were insistent and restless now.
      They seemed to have a plan of campaign, and they began to carry it out.
      First one, then another, brushed roughly against Charley. Cool and
      collected, he refused to accept the insults.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon," he said, in each case; "I am very awkward."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled all the time; he seemed waiting. The pushing and crowding became
      worse. "Don't mention it," he said. "You should learn how to carry your
      liquor in your legs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he changed from apology to attack. He talked at them with a
      cheerful scorn, a deprecating impertinence, as though they were children;
      he chided them with patient imprecations. This confused them for a moment
      and cleared a small space around him. There was no defiance in his aspect,
      no aggressiveness of manner; he was as quiet as though it were a
      drawing-room and he a master of monologues. He hurled original epithets at
      them in well-cadenced French, he called them what he listed, but in
      language which half-veiled the insults&mdash;the more infuriating to his
      hearers because they did not perfectly understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a low-set fellow, with brass rings in his ears, pulled off his
      coat and threw it on the floor. "I'll eat your heart," he said, and rolled
      up blue sleeves along a hairy arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My child," said Charley, "be careful what you eat. Take up your coat
      again, and learn that it is only dogs that delight to bark and bite. Our
      little hands were never made to tear each other's eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The low-set fellow made a rush forward, but Rouge Gosselin held him back.
      "No, no, Jougon," he said. "I have the oldest grudge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jougon struggled with Rouge Gosselin. "Be good, Jougon," said Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke a heavy tumbler flew from the other side of the room. Charley
      saw the missile thrown and dodged. It missed his temple, but caught the
      rim of his straw hat, carrying it off his head, and crashed into a lantern
      hanging against the wall, putting out the light. The room was only lighted
      now by another lantern on the other side of the room. Charley stooped,
      picked up his hat, and put it on his head again coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop that, or I'll clear the bar!" cried Theophile Charlemagne, taking
      the pistol Suzon slipped into his hand. The sight of the pistol drove the
      men wild, and more than one snatched at the knife in his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant there pushed forward into the clear space beside Charley
      Steele the great figure of Jake Hough, the horse-doctor, the strongest
      man, and the most popular Englishman on the river. He took his stand by
      Charley, raised his great hand, smote him in the small of his back, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the Lord, you have sand, and I'll stand by you!" Under the friendly
      but heavy stroke the monocle shot from Charley's eye the length of the
      string. Charley lifted it again, put it up, and staring hard at Jake,
      coolly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon&mdash;but have I ever&mdash;been introduced to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      What unbelievable indifference to danger, what disdain to friendliness,
      made Charley act as he did is a matter for speculation. It was throwing
      away his one chance; it was foppery on the scaffold&mdash;an incorrigible
      affectation or a relentless purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jake Hough strode forward into the crowd, rage in his eye. "Go to the
      devil, then, and take care of yourself!" he said roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please," said Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were the last words he uttered that night, for suddenly the other
      lantern went out, there was a rush and a struggle, a muffled groan, a
      shrill woman's voice, a scramble and hurrying feet, a noise of a something
      splashing heavily in the water outside. When the lights were up again the
      room was empty, save for Theophile Charlemagne, Jake Hough, and Suzon, who
      lay in a faint on the floor with a nasty bruise on her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      A score of river-drivers were scattering into the country-side, and
      somewhere in the black river, alive or dead, was Charley Steele.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. OLD DEBTS FOR NEW
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jo Portugtais was breaking the law of the river&mdash;he was running a
      little raft down the stream at night, instead of tying up at sundown and
      camping on the shore, or sitting snugly over cooking-pot by the little
      wooden caboose on his raft. But defiance of custom and tradition was a
      habit with Jo Portugais. He had lived in his own way many a year, and he
      was likely to do so till the end, though he was a young man yet. He had
      many professions, or rather many gifts, which he practised as it pleased
      him. He was river-driver, woodsman, hunter, carpenter, guide, as whim or
      opportunity came to him. On the evening when Charley Steele met with his
      mishap he was a river-driver&mdash;or so it seemed. He had been up
      nor'west a hundred and fifty miles, and he had come down-stream alone with
      his raft-which in the usual course should take two men to guide it&mdash;through
      slides, over rapids, and in strong currents. Defying the code of the
      river, with only one small light at the rear of his raft, he voyaged the
      swift current towards his home, which, when he arrived opposite the Cote
      Dorion, was still a hundred miles below. He had watched the lights in the
      river-drivers' camps, had seen the men beside the fires, and had drifted
      on, with no temptation to join in the songs floating out over the dark
      water, to share the contents of the jugs raised to boisterous lips, or to
      thrust his hand into the greasy cooking-pot for a succulent bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drifted on until he came opposite Charlemagne's tavern. Here the
      current carried him inshore. He saw the dim light, he saw dark figures in
      the bar-room, he even got a glimpse of Suzon Charlemagne. He dropped the
      house behind quickly, but looked back, leaning on the oar and thinking how
      swift was the rush of the current past the tavern. His eyes were on the
      tavern door and the light shining through it. Suddenly the light
      disappeared, and the door vanished into darkness. He heard a scuffle, and
      then a heavy splash.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's trouble there," said Jo Portugais, straining his eyes through the
      night, for a kind of low roar, dwindling to a loud whispering, and then a
      noise of hurrying feet, came down the stream, and he could dimly see dark
      figures running away into the night by different paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some dirty work, very sure," said Jo Portugais, and his eyes travelled
      back over the dark water like a lynx's, for the splash was in his ear, and
      a sort of prescience possessed him. He could not stop his raft. It must go
      on down the current, or be swerved to the shore, to be fastened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows, it had an ugly sound," said Jo Portugais, and again strained
      his eyes and ears. He shifted his position and took another oar, where the
      raft-lantern might not throw a reflection upon the water. He saw a light
      shine again through the tavern doorway, then a dark object block the
      light, and a head thrust forward towards the river as though listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment he fancied he saw something in the water nearing him. He
      stretched his neck. Yes, there was something.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a man. God save us&mdash;was it murder?" said Jo Portugais, and
      shuddered. "Was it murder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The body moved more swiftly than the raft. There was a hand thrust up&mdash;two
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's alive!" said Jo Portugais, and, hurriedly pulling round his waist a
      rope tied to a timber, jumped into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three minutes later, on the raft, he was examining a wound in the head of
      an insensible man.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his hand wandered over the body towards the heart, it touched something
      that rattled against a button. He picked it up mechanically and held it to
      the light. It was an eye-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God!" said Jo Portugais, and peered into the man's face. "It's him."
      Then he remembered the last words the man had spoken to him&mdash;"Get out
      of my sight. You're as guilty as hell!" But his heart yearned towards the
      man nevertheless.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE WAY IN AND THE WAY OUT
    </h2>
    <p>
      In his own world of the parish of Chaudiere Jo Portugais was counted a
      widely travelled man. He had adventured freely on the great rivers and in
      the forests, and had journeyed up towards Hudson's Bay farther than any
      man in seven parishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo's father and mother had both died in one year&mdash;when he was
      twenty-five. That year had turned him from a clean-shaven cheerful boy
      into a morose bearded man who looked forty, for it had been marked by his
      disappearance from Chaudiere and his return at the end of it, to find his
      mother dead and his father dying broken-hearted. What had driven Jo from
      home only his father knew; what had happened to him during that year only
      Jo himself knew, and he told no one, not even his dying father.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mystery surrounded him, and no one pierced it. He was a figure apart in
      Chaudiere parish. A dreadful memory that haunted him, carried him out of
      the village, which clustered round the parish church, into Vadrome
      Mountain, three miles away, where he lived apart from all his kind. It was
      here he brought the man with the eye-glass one early dawn, after two
      nights and two days on the river, pulling him up the long hill in a low
      cart with his strong faithful dogs, hitching himself with them and toiling
      upwards through the dark. In his three-roomed hut he laid his charge down
      upon a pile of bear-skins, and tended him with a strange gentleness,
      bathing the wound in the head and binding it again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the sick man opened his eyes heavily. He then began
      fumbling mechanically on his breast. At last his fingers found his
      monocle. He feebly put it to his eye, and looked at Jo in a strange,
      questioning, uncomprehending way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg&mdash;your pardon," he said haltingly, "have I ever&mdash;been
      intro&mdash;" Suddenly his eyes closed, a frown gathered on his forehead.
      After a minute his eyes opened again, and he gazed with painful, pathetic
      seriousness at Jo. This grew to a kind of childish terror; then slowly, as
      a shadow passes, the perplexity, anxiety and terror cleared away, and left
      his forehead calm, his eyes unvexed and peaceful. The monocle dropped, and
      he did not heed it. At length he said wearily, and with an incredibly
      simple dependence:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am thirsty now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo lifted a wooden bowl to his lips, and he drank, drank, drank to
      repletion. When he had finished he patted Jo's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am always thirsty," he said. "I shall be hungry too. I always am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo brought him some milk and bread in a bowl. When the sick man had eaten
      and drunk the bowlful to the last drop and crumb, he lay back with a sigh
      of content, but trembling from weakness and the strain, though Jo's hand
      had been under his head, and he had been fed like a little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day he lay and watched Jo as he worked, as he came and went. Sometimes
      he put his hand to his head and said to Jo: "It hurts." Then Jo would cool
      the wound with fresh water from the mountain spring, and he would drag
      down the bowl to drink from it greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as though he could never get enough water to drink. So the first
      day in the hut at Vadrome Mountain passed without questioning on the part
      of either Charley Steele or his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      With good reason. Jo Portugais saw that memory was gone; that the past was
      blotted out. He had watched that first terrible struggle of memory to
      reassert itself, as the eyes mechanically looked out upon new and strange
      surroundings, but it was only the automatic habit of the sight, the
      fumbling of the blind soul in its cell-fumbling for the latch which it
      could not find, for the door which would not open. The first day on the
      raft, as Charley had opened his eyes upon the world again after that awful
      night at the Cote Dorion, Jo. had seen that same blank uncomprehending
      look&mdash;as it were, the first look of a mind upon the world. This time
      he saw, and understood what he saw, and spoke as men speak, but with no
      knowledge or memory behind it&mdash;only the involuntary action of muscle
      and mind repeated from the vanished past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley Steele was as a little child, and having no past, and
      comprehending in the present only its limited physical needs and motions,
      he had no hope, no future, no understanding. In three days he was upon his
      feet, and in four he walked out of doors and followed Jo into the woods,
      and watched him fell a tree and do a woodsman's work. Indoors he regarded
      all Jo did with eager interest and a pleased, complacent look, and readily
      did as he was told. He seldom spoke&mdash;not above three or four times a
      day, and then simply and directly, and only concerning his wants. From
      first to last he never asked a question, and there was never any inquiry
      by look or word. A hundred and twenty miles lay between him and his old
      home, between him and Kathleen and Billy and Jean Jolicoeur's saloon, but
      between him and his past life the unending miles of eternity intervened.
      He was removed from it as completely as though he were dead and buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month went by. Sometimes Jo went down to the village below, and then, at
      first, he locked the door of the house behind him upon Charley. Against
      this Charley made no motion and said no word, but patiently awaited Jo's
      return. So it was that, at last, Jo made no attempt to lock the door, but
      with a nod or a good-bye left him alone. When Charley saw him returning he
      would go to meet him, and shake hands with him, and say "Good-day," and
      then would come in with him and help him get supper or do the work of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Charley came no one had visited the house, for there were no paths
      beyond it, and no one came to the Vadrome Mountain, save by chance. But
      after two months had gone the Cure came. Twice a year the Cure made it a
      point to visit Jo in the interests of his soul, though the visits came to
      little, for Jo never went to confession, and seldom to mass. On this
      occasion the Cure arrived when Jo was out in the woods. He discovered
      Charley. Charley made no answer to his astonished and friendly greeting,
      but watched him with a wide-eyed anxiety till the Cure seated himself at
      the door to await Jo's coming. Presently, as he sat there, Charley, who
      had studied his face as a child studies the unfamiliar face of a stranger,
      brought him a bowl of bread and milk and put it in his hands. The Cure
      smiled and thanked him, and Charley smiled in return and said: "It is very
      good."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Cure ate, Charley watched him with satisfaction, and nodded at him
      kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jo came he lied to the Cure. He said he had found Charley wandering
      in the woods, with a wound in his head, and had brought him home with him
      and cared for him. Forty miles away he had found him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure was perplexed. What was there to do? He believed what Jo said. So
      far as he knew, Jo had never lied to him before, and he thought he
      understood Jo's interest in this man with the look of a child and no
      memory: Jo's life was terribly lonely; he had no one to care for, and no
      one cared for him; here was what might comfort him! Through this helpless
      man might come a way to Jo's own good. So he argued with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      What to do? Tell the story to the world by writing to the newspaper at
      Quebec? Jo pooh-poohed this. Wait till the man's memory came back? Would
      it come back&mdash;what chance was there of its ever coming back? Jo said
      that they ought to wait and see&mdash;wait awhile, and then, if his memory
      did not return, they would try to find his friends, by publishing his
      story abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaudiere was far from anywhere: it knew little of the world, and the
      world knew naught of it, and this was a large problem for the Cure.
      Perhaps Jo was right, he thought. The man was being well cared for, and
      what more could be wished at the moment? The Cure was a simple man, and
      when Jo urged that if the sick man could get well anywhere in the world it
      would be at Vadrome Mountain in Chaudiere, the Cure's parochial pride was
      roused, and he was ready to believe all Jo said. He also saw reason in
      Jo's request that the village should not be told of the sick man's
      presence. Before he left, the Cure knelt down and prayed, "for the good of
      this poor mortal's soul and body."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he prayed, Charley knelt down also, and kept his eyes-calm unwondering
      eyes-full fixed on the good M. Loisel, whose grey hair, thin peaceful
      face, and dark brown eyes made a noble picture of patience and devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Cure shook him by the hand, murmuring in good-bye, "God be
      gracious to thee, my son," Charley nodded in a friendly way. He watched
      the departing figure till it disappeared over the crest of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day marked an epoch in the solitude of the hut on Vadrome Mountain.
      Jo had an inspiration. He got a second set of carpenter's tools, and
      straightway began to build a new room to the house. He gave the extra set
      of tools to Charley with an encouraging word. For the first time since he
      had been brought here, Charley's face took on a look of interest. In
      half-an-hour he was at work, smiling and perspiring, and quickly learning
      the craft. He seldom spoke, but he sometimes laughed a mirthful, natural
      boy's laugh of good spirits and contentment. From that day his interest in
      things increased, and before two months went round, while yet it was late
      autumn, he looked in perfect health. He ate moderately, drank a great deal
      of water, and slept half the circle of the clock each day. His skin was
      like silk; the colour of his face was as that of an apple; he was more
      than ever Beauty Steele. The Cure came two or three times, and Charley
      spoke to him but never held conversation, and no word concerning the past
      ever passed his tongue, nor did he have memory of what was said to him
      from one day to the next. A hundred ways Jo had tried to rouse his memory.
      But the words Cote Dorion had no meaning to him, and he listened blankly
      to all names and phrases once so familiar. Yet he spoke French and English
      in a slow, passive, involuntary way. All was automatic, mechanical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weeks again wore on, and autumn became winter, and then at last one
      day the Cure came, bringing his brother, a great Parisian surgeon lately
      arrived from France on a short visit. The Cure had told his brother the
      story, and had been met by a keen, astonished interest in the unknown man
      on Vadrome Mountain. A slight pressure on the brain from accident had
      before now produced loss of memory&mdash;the great man's professional
      curiosity was aroused: he saw a nice piece of surgical work ready to his
      hand; he asked to be taken to Vadrome Mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Cure had lived long out of the world, and was not in touch with
      the swift-minded action and adventuring intellects of such men as his
      brother, Marcel Loisel. Was it not tempting Providence, a surgical
      operation? He was so used to people getting ill and getting well without a
      doctor&mdash;the nearest was twenty miles distant&mdash;or getting ill and
      dying in what seemed a natural and preordained way, that to cut open a
      man's head and look into his brain, and do this or that to his skull,
      seemed almost sinful. Was it not better to wait and see if the poor man
      would not recover in God's appointed time?
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to his sensitively eager and diverse questions, Marcel Loisel
      replied that his dear Cure was merely mediaeval, and that he had
      sacrificed his mental powers on the altar of a simple faith, which might
      remove mountains but was of no value in a case like this, where, clearly,
      surgery was the only providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the Cure got to his feet, came over, laid his hand on his
      brother's shoulder, and said, with tears in his eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marcel, you shock me. Indeed you shock me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he twisted a knot in his cassock cords, and added "Come then, Marcel.
      We will go to him. And may God guide us aright!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon the two grey-haired men visited Vadrome Mountain, and there
      they found Charley at work in the little room that the two men had built.
      Charley nodded pleasantly when the Cure introduced his brother, but showed
      no further interest at first. He went on working at the cupboard under his
      hand. His cap was off and his hair was a little rumpled where the wound
      had been, for he had a habit of rubbing the place now and then&mdash;an
      abstracted, sensitive motion&mdash;although he seemed to suffer no pain.
      The surgeon's eyes fastened on the place, and as Charley worked and his
      brother talked, he studied the man, the scar, the contour of the head. At
      last he came up to Charley and softly placed his fingers on the scar,
      feeling the skull. Charley turned quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the long, piercing look of the surgeon which seemed
      to come through limitless space to the sleeping and imprisoned memory of
      Charley's sick mind. A confused, anxious, half-fearful look crept into the
      wide blue eyes. It was like a troubled ghost, flitting along the
      boundaries of sight and sense, and leaving a chill and a horrified wonder
      behind. The surgeon gazed on, and the trouble in Charley's eye passed to
      his face, stayed an instant. Then he turned away to Jo Portugais. "I am
      thirsty now," he said, and he touched his lips in the way he was wont to
      do in those countless ages ago, when, millions upon millions of miles
      away, people said: "There goes Charley Steele!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am thirsty now," and that touch of the lip with the tongue, were a
      revelation to the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later he was walking homeward with the Cure. Jo accompanied
      them for a distance. As they emerged into the wider road-paths that began
      half-way down the mountain, the Cure, who had watched his brother's face
      for a long time in silence, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is in your mind, Marcel?" The surgeon turned with a half-smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is happy now. No memory, no conscience, no pain, no responsibility, no
      trouble&mdash;nothing behind or before. Is it good to bring him back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure had thought it all over, and he had wholly changed his mind since
      that first talk with his brother. "To save a mind, Marcel!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then to save a soul?" suggested the surgeon. "Would he thank me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is our duty to save him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Body and mind and soul, eh? And if I look after the body and the mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His soul is in God's hands, Marcel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But will he thank me? How can you tell what sorrows, what troubles, he
      has had? What struggles, temptations, sins? He has none now, of any sort;
      not a stain, physical or moral."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not life, Marcel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, you have changed. This morning it was I who would, and you
      hesitated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see differently now, Marcel."
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon put a hand playfully on his brother's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you think, my dear Prosper, that I should hesitate? Am I a
      sentimentalist? But what will he say?
    </p>
    <p>
      "We need not think of that, Marcel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But yet suppose that with memory come again sin and shame&mdash;even
      crime?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will pray for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if he isn't a Catholic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One must pray for sinners," said the Curb, after a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the surgeon laid a hand on the shoulder of his brother
      affectionately. "Upon my soul, dear Prosper, you almost persuade me to be
      reactionary and mediaeval."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Curb turned half uneasily towards Jo, who was following at a little
      distance. This seemed hardly the sort of thing for him to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better return now, Jo," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you wish, M'sieu'," Jo answered, then looked inquiringly at the
      surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In about five days, Portugais. Have you a steady hand and a quick eye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo spread out his hands in deprecation, and turned to the Curb, as though
      for him to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jo is something of a physician and surgeon too, Marcel. He has a gift. He
      has cured many in the parish with his herbs and tinctures, and he has set
      legs and arms successfully."
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon eyed Jo humorously, but kindly. "He is probably as good a
      doctor as some of us. Medicine is a gift, surgery is a gift and an art.
      You shall hear from me, Portugais." He looked again keenly at Jo. "You
      have not given him 'herbs and tinctures'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, M'sieu'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very sensible. Good-day, Portugais."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-day, my son," said the priest, and raised his fingers in
      benediction, as Jo turned and quickly retraced his steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you ask him if he had given the poor man any herbs or tinctures,
      Marcel?" said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because those quack tinctures have whiskey in them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whiskey in any form would be bad for him," the surgeon answered
      evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to himself he kept saying: "The man was a drunkard&mdash;he was a
      drunkard."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE RAISING OF THE CURTAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      M. Marcel Loisel did his work with a masterly precision, with the aid of
      his brother and Portugais. The man under the instruments, not wholly
      insensible, groaned once or twice. Once or twice, too, his eyes opened
      with a dumb hunted look, then closed as with an irresistible weariness.
      When the work was over, and every stain or sign of surgery removed, sleep
      came down on the bed&mdash;a deep and saturating sleep, which seemed to
      fill the room with peace. For hours the surgeon sat beside the couch, now
      and again feeling the pulse, wetting the hot lips, touching the forehead
      with his palm. At last, with a look of satisfaction, he came forward to
      where Jo and the Cure sat beside the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all right," he said. "Let him sleep as long as he will." He turned
      again to the bed. "I wish I could stay to see the end of it. Is there no
      chance, Prosper?" he added to the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible, Marcel. You must have sleep. You have a seventy-mile drive
      before you to-morrow, and sixty the next day. You can only reach the port
      now by starting at daylight to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that Marcel Loisel, the great surgeon, was compelled to leave
      Chaudiere before he knew that the memory of the man who had been under his
      knife had actually returned to him. He had, however, no doubt in his own
      mind, and he was confident that there could be no physical harm from the
      operation. Sleep was the all-important thing. In it lay the strength for
      the shock of the awakening&mdash;if awakening of memory there was to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he left he stooped over Charley and said musingly: "I wonder what
      you will wake up to, my friend?" Then he touched the wound with a light
      caressing finger. "It was well done, well done," he murmured proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment afterwards he was hurrying down the hill to the open road, where
      a cariole awaited the Cure and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a day and a half Charley slept, and Jo watched him with an
      affectionate solicitude. Once or twice, becoming anxious, because of the
      heavy breathing and the motionless sleep, he had forced open the teeth,
      and poured a little broth between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before dawn on the second morning, worn out and heavy with slumber,
      Jo lay down by the piled-up fire and dropped into a sleep that wrapped him
      like a blanket, folding him away into a drenching darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time there was a deep silence, troubled only by Jo's deep breathing,
      which seemed itself like the pulse of the silence. Charley appeared not to
      be breathing at all. He was lying on his back, seemingly lifeless.
      Suddenly on the snug silence there was a sharp sound. A tree outside
      snapped with the frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley awoke. The body seemed not to awake, for it did not stir, but the
      eyes opened wide and full, looking straight before them&mdash;straight up
      to the brown smoke-stained rafters, along which were ranged guns and
      fishing-tackle, axes and bear-traps. Full clear blue eyes, healthy and
      untired as a child's fresh from an all-night's drowse, they looked and
      looked. Yet, at first, the body did not stir; only the mind seemed to be
      awakening, the soul creeping out from slumber into the day. Presently,
      however, as the eyes gazed, there stole into them a wonder, a trouble, an
      anxiety. For a moment they strained at the rafters and the crude weapons
      and implements there, then the body moved, quickly, eagerly, and turned to
      see the flickering shadows made by the fire and the simple order of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute more, and Charley was sitting on the side of his couch, dazed and
      staring. This hut, this fire, the figure by the hearth in a sound
      sleep-his hand went to his head: it felt the bandage there!
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered now! Last night at the Cote Dorion! Last night he had talked
      with Suzon Charlemagne at the Cote Dorion; last night he had drunk harder
      than he had ever drunk in his life, he had defied, chaffed, insulted the
      river-drivers. The whole scene came back: the faces of Suzon and her
      father; Suzon's fingers on his for an instant; the glass of brandy beside
      him; the lanterns on the walls; the hymn he sang; the sermon he preached&mdash;he
      shuddered a little; the rumble of angry noises round him; the tumbler
      thrown; the crash of the lantern, and only one light left in the place!
      Then Jake Hough and his heavy hand, the flying monocle, and his
      disdainful, insulting reply; the sight of the pistol in the hand of
      Suzon's father; then a rush, a darkness, and his own fierce plunge towards
      the door, beyond which were the stars and the cool night and the dark
      river. Curses, hands that battered and tore at him, the doorway reached,
      and then a blow on the head and&mdash;falling, falling, falling, and
      distant noises growing more distant, and suddenly and sweetly&mdash;absolute
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he shuddered. Why? He remembered that scene in his office yesterday
      with Kathleen, and the one later with Billy. A sensitive chill swept all
      over him, making his flesh creep, and a flush sped over his face from chin
      to brow. To-day he must pick up all these threads again, must make things
      right for Billy, must replace the money he had stolen, must face Kathleen
      again he shuddered. Was he at the Cote Dorion still? He looked round him.
      No, this was not the sort of house to be found at the Cote Dorion. Clearly
      this was the hut of a hunter. Probably he had been fished out of the river
      by this woodsman and brought here. He felt his head. The wound was fresh
      and very sore. He had played for death, with an insulting disdain, yet
      here he was alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly he was not intended to be drowned or knifed&mdash;he remembered
      the knives he saw unsheathed&mdash;or kicked or pummelled into the
      hereafter. It was about ten o'clock when he had had his "accident"&mdash;he
      affected a smile, yet somehow he did not smile easily&mdash;it must be now
      about five, for here was the morning creeping in behind the deer-skin
      blind at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange that he felt none the worse for his mishap, and his tongue was as
      clean and fresh as if he had been drinking milk last night, and not very
      doubtful brandy at the Cote Dorion. No fever in his hands, no headache,
      only the sore skull, so well and tightly bandaged but a wonderful thirst,
      and an intolerable hunger. He smiled. When had he ever been hungry for
      breakfast before? Here he was with a fine appetite: it was like coals of
      fire heaped on his head by Nature for last night's business at the Cote
      Dorion. How true it was that penalties did not always come with&mdash;indiscretions.
      Yet, all at once, he flushed again to the forehead, for a curious sense of
      shame flashed through his whole being, and one Charley Steele&mdash;the
      Charley Steele of this morning, an unknown, unadventuring, onlooking
      Charley Steele&mdash;was viewing with abashed eyes the Charley Steele who
      had ended a doubtful career in the coarse and desperate proceedings of
      last night. With a nervous confusion he sought refuge in his eye-glass.
      His fingers fumbled over his waistcoat, but did not find it. The weapon of
      defence and attack, the symbol of interrogation and incomprehensibility,
      was gone. Beauty Steele was under the eyes of another self, and neither
      disdain, nor contempt, nor the passive stare, were available. He got
      suddenly to his feet, and started forward, as though to find refuge from
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abrupt action sent the blood to his head, and feeling a blindness come
      over him, he put both hands up to his temples, and sank back on the couch,
      dizzy and faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      His motions waked Jo Portugais, who scrambled from the floor, and came
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M'sieu'," he said, "you must not. You are faint." He dropped his hands
      supportingly to Charley's shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley nodded, but did not yet look up. His head throbbed sorely. "Water&mdash;please!"
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant Jo was beside him again, with a bowl of fresh water at his
      lips. He drank, drank, drank, until the great bowl was drained to the last
      drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whew! That was good!" he said, and looked up at Jo with a smile. "Thank
      you, my friend; I haven't the honour of your acquaintance, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped suddenly and stared at Jo. Inquiry, mystification, were in his
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I ever seen you before?" he said. "Who knows, M'sieu'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Jo had stood before Charley in the dock near six years ago he had
      greatly changed. The marks of smallpox, a heavy beard, grey hair, and
      solitary life had altered him beyond Charley's recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo could hardly speak. His legs were trembling under him, for now he knew
      that Charley Steele was himself again. He was no longer the simple, quiet
      man-child of three days ago, and of these months past, but the man who had
      saved him from hanging, to whom he owed a debt he dare not acknowledge.
      Jo's brain was in a muddle. Now that the great crisis was over, now that
      the expected thing had come, and face to face with the cure, he had
      neither tongue, nor strength, nor wit. His words stuck in his throat where
      his heart was, and for a minute his eyes had a kind of mist before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Charley's eyes were upon him, curious, fixed, abstracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this your house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, M'sieu'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You fished me out of the river by the Cote Dorion?" He still held his
      head with his hands, for it throbbed so, but his eyes were intent on his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, M'sieu'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley's hand mechanically fumbled for his monocle. Jo turned quickly to
      the wall, and taking it by its cord from the nail where it had been for
      these long months, handed it over. Charley took it and mechanically put it
      in his eye. "Thank you, my friend," he said. "Have I been conscious at all
      since you rescued me last night?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a way, M'sieu'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, well, I can't remember, but it was very kind of you&mdash;I do thank
      you very much. Do you think you could find me something to eat? I beg your
      pardon&mdash;it isn't breakfast-time, of course, but I was never so hungry
      in my life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a minute, M'sieu'&mdash;in one minute. But lie down, you must lie down
      a little. You got up too quick, and it makes your head throb. You have had
      nothing to eat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, since yesterday noon, and very little then. I didn't eat
      anything at the Cote Dorion, I remember." He lay back on the couch and
      closed his eyes. The throbbing in his head presently stopped, and he felt
      that if he ate something he could go to sleep again, it was so restful in
      this place&mdash;a whole day's sleep and rest, how good it would be after
      last night's racketing! Here was primitive and material comfort, the
      secret of content, if you liked! Here was this poor hunter-fellow, with
      enough to eat and to drink, earning it every day by every day's labour,
      and, like Robinson Crusoe no doubt, living in a serene self-sufficiency
      and an elysian retirement. Probably he had no responsibilities in the
      world, with no one to say him nay, himself only to consider in all the
      universe: a divine conception of adequate life. Yet himself, Charley
      Steele, an idler, a waster, with no purpose in life, with scarcely the
      necessity to earn his bread-never, at any rate, until lately&mdash;was the
      slave of the civilisation to which he belonged. Was civilisation worth the
      game?
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand involuntarily went to his head. It changed the course of his
      thoughts. He must go back to-day to put Billy's crime right, to replace
      the trust-moneys Billy had taken by forging his brother-in-law's name. Not
      a moment must be lost. No doubt he was within driving distance of his
      office, and, bandaged head or no bandaged head, last night's disgraceful
      doings notwithstanding, it was his duty to face the wondering eyes&mdash;what
      did he care for wondering eyes? hadn't he been making eyes wonder all his
      life?&mdash;face the wondering eyes in the little city, and set a crooked
      business straight. Fool and scoundrel certainly Billy was, but there was
      Kathleen!
    </p>
    <p>
      His lips tightened; he had a strange anxious flutter of the heart. When
      had his heart fluttered like this? When had he ever before considered
      Kathleen's feelings as to his personal conduct so delicately? Well, since
      yesterday he did feel it, and a sudden sense of pity sprang up in him&mdash;vague,
      shamefaced pity, which belied the sudden egotistical flourish with which
      he put his monocle to his eye and tried futilely to smile in the old way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had lain with his eyes closed. They opened now, and he saw his host
      spreading a newspaper as a kind of cloth on a small rough table, and
      putting some food upon it-bread, meat, and a bowl of soup. It was
      thoughtful of this man to make his soup overnight-he saw Jo lift it from
      beside the fire where it had been kept hot. A good fellow-an excellent
      fellow, this woodsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head did not throb now, and he drew himself up slowly on his
      elbow-then, after a moment, lifted himself to a sitting posture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your name, my friend?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jo Portugais, M'sieu'," Jo answered, and brought a candle and put it on
      the table, then lifted the tin-plate from over the bowl of savoury soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had Charley Steele sat down to such a breakfast. A roll and a
      cup of coffee had been enough, and often too much, for him. Yet now he
      could not wait to eat the soup with a spoon, but lifted the bowl and took
      a long draught of it, and set it down with a sigh of content. Then he
      broke bread into the soup&mdash;large pieces of black oat bread&mdash;until
      the bowl was a mass of luscious pulp. This he ate almost ravenously, his
      eye wandering avidly the while to the small piece of meat beside the bowl.
      What meat was it? It looked like venison, yet summer was not the time for
      venison. What did it matter! Jo sat on a bench beside the fire, his face
      turned towards his guest, dreading the moment when the man he had nursed
      and cared for, with whom he had eaten and drunk for so long, should know
      the truth about himself. He could not tell him all there was to tell, he
      was taking another means of letting him know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley did not speak. Hunger was a new sensation, a delicious thing, too
      good to be broken by talking. He ate till he had cleared away the last
      crumbs of bread and meat and drunk the last drop of soup. He looked at the
      woodsman as though wondering if he would bring more. Jo evidently thought
      he had had enough, for he did not move. Charley's glance withdrew from Jo,
      and busied itself with the few crumbs remaining upon the table. He saw a
      little piece of bread on the floor. He picked it up and ate it with
      relish, laughing to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long will it take us to get to town? Can we do it this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not this morning, M'sieu'," said Jo, in a sort of hoarse whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many hours would it take?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gathering the last crumbs of his feast with his hand, and looking
      casually down at the newspaper spread as a table-cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once his hand stopped, his eyes became fixed on a spot in the
      paper. He gave a hoarse, guttural cry, like an animal in agony. His lips
      became dry, his hand wiped a blinding mist from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo watched him with an intense alarm and a horrified curiosity. He felt a
      base coward for not having told Charley what this paper contained. Never
      had he seen such a look as this. He felt his beads, and told them over and
      over again, as Charley Steele, in a dry, croaking sort of whisper, read,
      in letters that seemed monstrous symbols of fire, a record of himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-day, by special license from the civil and ecclesiastical courts [the
      paragraph in the paper began], was married, at St. Theobald's Church, Mrs.
      Charles Steele, daughter of the late Hon. Julien Wantage, and niece of the
      late Eustace Wantage, Esq., to Captain Thomas Fairing, of the Royal
      Fusileers&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley snatched at the top of the paper and read the date "Tenth of
      February, 18-!" It was August when he was at the Cote Dorion, the 5th
      August, 18-, and this paper was February 10th, 18-. He read on, in the
      month-old paper, with every nerve in his body throbbing now: a fierce
      beating that seemed as if it must burst the heart and the veins:
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;Captain Thomas Fairing, of the Royal Fusileers, whose career in
      our midst has been marked by an honourable sense of public and private
      duty. Our fellow-citizens will unite with us in congratulating the bride,
      whose previous misfortunes have only increased the respect in which she is
      held. If all remember the obscure death of her first husband (though the
      body was not found, there has never been a doubt of his death), and the
      subsequent discovery that he had embezzled trust-moneys to the extent of
      twenty-five thousand dollars, thereby setting the final seal of shame upon
      a misspent life, destined for brilliant and powerful uses, all have
      conspired to forget the association of our beautiful and admired
      townswoman with his career. It is painful to refer to these circumstances,
      but it is only within the past few days that the estate of the misguided
      man has been wound up, and the money he embezzled restored to its rightful
      owners; and it is better to make these remarks now than repeat them in the
      future, only to arouse painful memories in quarters where we should least
      desire to wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In her new life, blessed by a romantic devotion known and admired by all,
      Mrs. Fairing and her husband will be followed by the affectionate good
      wishes of the whole community."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man on the hearth-stone shrank back at the sight of the still, white
      face, in which the eyes were like sparks of fire. His impulse had been to
      go over and offer the hand of sympathy to the stricken man, but his simple
      mind grasped the fact that no one might, with impunity, invade this awful
      quiet. Charley was frozen in body, but his brain was awake with the heat
      of "a burning fiery furnace."
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven months of unconscious life-seven months of silence&mdash;no sight,
      no seeing, no knowing; seven months of oblivion, in which the world had
      buried him out of ken in an unknown grave of infamy! Seven months&mdash;and
      Kathleen was married again to the man she had always loved. To the world
      he himself was a rogue and thief. Billy had remained silent&mdash;Billy,
      whom he had so befriended, had let decent men heap scorn and reproaches on
      his memory. Here was what the world thought of him&mdash;he read the lines
      over again, his eyes scorching, but his finger steady, as it traced the
      lines slowly: "the obscure death..." "embezzled trustmoneys..." "the final
      seal of shame upon a misspent life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the epitaphs on the tombstone of Charley Steele; dead and
      buried, out of sight, out of repute, soon to be out of mind and out of
      memory, save as a warning to others&mdash;an old example raked out of the
      dust-bin of time by the scavengers of morality, to toss at all who trod
      the paths of dalliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was there to do? Go back? Go back and knock at Kathleen's door,
      another Enoch Arden, and say: "I have come to my own again?" Return and
      tell Tom Fairing to go his way and show his face no more? Break up this
      union, this marriage of love in which these two rejoiced? Summon Kathleen
      out of her illegal intercourse with the man who had been true to her all
      these years?
    </p>
    <p>
      To what end? What had he ever done for her that he might destroy her now?
      What sort of Spartan tragedy was this, that the woman who had been the
      victim of circumstances, who had been the slave to a tie he never felt,
      yet which had been as iron-bound to her, should now be brought out to be
      mangled body and soul for no fault of her own? What had she done? What had
      she ever done to give him right to touch so much as a hair of her head?
    </p>
    <p>
      Go back, and bring Billy to justice, and clear his own name? Go back, and
      send Kathleen's brother, the forger, to jail? What an achievement in
      justice! Would not the world have a right to say that the only decent
      thing he could do was to eliminate himself from the equation? What profit
      for him in the great summing-up, that he was technically innocent of this
      one thing, and that to establish his innocence he broke a woman's heart
      and destroyed a boy's life? To what end! It was the murderer coming back
      as a ghost to avenge himself for being hanged. Suppose he went back&mdash;the
      death's-head at the feast&mdash;what would there be for himself
      afterwards; for any one for whom he was responsible? Living at that price?
    </p>
    <p>
      To die and end it all, to disappear from this petty life where he had done
      so little, and that little ill? To die?
    </p>
    <p>
      No. There was in him some deep, if obscure, fatalism after all. If he had
      been meant to die now, why had he not gone to the bottom of the river that
      yesterday at the Cote Dorion? Why had he been saved by this yokel at the
      fire, and brought here to lie in oblivion in this mountain hut, wrapped in
      silence and lost to the world? Why had his brain and senses lain fallow
      all these months, a vacuous vegetation, an empty consciousness? Was it
      fate? Did it not seem probable that the Great Machine had, in its
      automatic movement, tossed him up again on the shores of Time because he
      had not fallen on the trap-door predestined for his eternal exit?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear to him that death by his own hand was futile, and that if
      there were trap-doors set for him alone, it were well to wait until he
      trod upon them and fell through in his appointed hour in the movement of
      the Great Machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      What to do&mdash;where to live&mdash;how to live?
    </p>
    <p>
      He got slowly to his feet and took a step forward half blindly. The man on
      the bench stirred. Crossing the room he dropped a hand on the man's
      shoulder. "Open the blind, my friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo Portugais got to his feet quickly, eyes averted&mdash;he did not dare
      look into Charley's face&mdash;and went over and drew back the deer-skin
      blind. The clear, crisp sunlight of a frosty morning broke gladly into the
      room. Charley turned and blew out the candle on the table where he had
      eaten, then walked feebly to the window. Standing on the crest of the
      mountain the hut looked down through a clearing, flanked by forest trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a goodly scene. The green and frosted foliage of the pines and
      cedars; the flowery tracery of frost hanging like cobwebs everywhere; the
      poudre sparkle in the air; the hills of silver and emerald sloping down to
      the valley miles away, where the village clustered about the great old
      parish church; the smoke from a hundred chimneys, in purple spirals,
      rising straight up in the windless air; over all peace and a perfect
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley mechanically fixed his eye-glass and stood with hands resting on
      the window-sill, looking, looking out upon a new world.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there anything I can do for you, M'sieu'?" said Jo huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley held out his hand and clasped Jo's. "Tell me about all these
      months," he said.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE COMING OF ROSALIE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Charley Steele saw himself as he had been through the eyes of another. He
      saw the work that he had done in the carpentering shed, and had no memory
      of it. The real Charley Steele had been enveloped in oblivion for seven
      months. During that time a mild phantom of himself had wandered, as it
      were in a somnambulistic dream, through the purlieus of life. Open-eyed,
      but with the soul asleep, all idiosyncrasy laid aside, all acquired
      impressions and influences vanished, he had been walking in the world with
      no more complexity of mind than a new-born child, nothing intervening
      between the sight of the eyes and the original sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when the real Charley Steele emerged again, the folds of mind and
      soul unrolling to the million-voiced creation and touched by the antenna
      of a various civilisation, the phantom Charley was gone once more into
      obscurity. The real Charley could remember naught of the other, could feel
      naught, save, as in the stirring industrious day, one remembers that he
      has dreamed a strange dream the night before, and cannot recall it, though
      the overpowering sense of it remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the work of his hands, the things he had made with adze and plane,
      with chisel and hammer, but nothing seemed familiar save the smell of the
      glue pot, which brought back in a cloudy impression curious unfamiliar
      feelings. Sights, sounds, motions, passed in a confused way through his
      mind as the smell of the glue crept through his nostrils; and he struggled
      hard to remember. But no&mdash;seven months of his life were gone for
      ever. Yet he knew and felt that a vast change had gone over him, had
      passed through him. While the soul had lain fallow, while the body had
      been growing back to childlike health again, and Nature had been pouring
      into his sick senses her healing balm; while the medicaments of peace and
      sleep and quiet labour had been having their way with him, he had been
      reorganised, renewed, flushed of the turgid silt of dissipation. For his
      sins and weaknesses there had been no gall and vinegar to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Charley stood looking round the workshop, Jo entered, shaking the snow
      from his moccasined feet. "The Cure, M'sieu' Loisel, has come," he said.
      Charley turned, and, without a word, followed Jo into the house. There,
      standing at the window and looking down at the village beneath, was the
      Cure. As Charley entered, M. Loisel came forward with outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to see you well again, Monsieur," he said, and his cool thin
      hand held Charley's for a moment, as he looked him benignly in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a kind of instinct as to the course he must henceforth pursue,
      Charley replied simply, dropping his eye-glass as he met that clear
      soluble look of the priest&mdash;such a well of simplicity he had never
      before seen. Only naked eye could meet that naked eye, imperfect though
      his own sight was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is good of you to feel so, and to come and tell me so," he answered
      quietly. "I have been a great trouble, I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was none of the old pose in his manner, none of the old cryptic
      quality in his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were anxious for your sake&mdash;and for the sake of your friends,
      Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley evaded the suggestion. "I cannot easily repay your kindness and
      that of Jo Portugais, my good friend here," he rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M'sieu'," replied Jo, his face turned away, and his foot pushing a log on
      the fire, "you have repaid it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley shook his head. "I am in a conspiracy of kindness," he said. "It
      is all a mystery to me. For why should one expect such treatment from
      strangers, when, besides all, one can never make any real return, not even
      to pay for board and lodging!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I was a stranger and ye took me in,"' said the Cure, smiling by no means
      sentimentally. "So said the Friend of the World."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley looked the Curb steadily in the eyes. He was thinking how simply
      this man had said these things; as if, indeed, they were part of his life;
      as though it were usual speech with him, a something that belonged, not an
      acquired language. There was the old impulse to ask a question, and he put
      the monocle to his eye, but his lips did not open, and the eye-glass fell
      again. He had seen familiarity with sacred names and things in the
      uneducated, in excited revivalists, worked up to a state clairvoyant and
      conversational with the Creator; but he had never heard an educated man
      speak as this man did.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Charley said: "Your brother&mdash;Portugais tells me that your
      brother, the surgeon, has gone away. I should have liked to thank him&mdash;if
      no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have written him of your good recovery. He will be glad, I know. But my
      brother, from one stand-point&mdash;a human stand-point&mdash;had
      scruples. These I did not share, but they were strong in him, Monsieur.
      Marcel asked himself&mdash;" He stopped suddenly and looked towards Jo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley saw the look, and said quickly: "Speak plainly. Portugais is my
      friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo turned slowly towards him, and a light seemed to come to his eyes&mdash;a
      shining something that resolved itself into a dog-like fondness, an utter
      obedience, a strange intense gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marcel asked himself," the Cure continued, "whether you would thank him
      for bringing you back to&mdash;to life and memory. I fear he was trying to
      see what I should say&mdash;I fear so. Marcel said, 'Suppose that he
      should curse me for it? Who knows what he would be brought back to&mdash;to
      what suffering and pain, perhaps?' Marcel said that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you replied, Monsieur le Cure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I replied that Nature required you to answer that question for yourself,
      and whether bitterly or gladly, it was your duty to take up your life and
      live it out. Besides, it was not you alone that had to be considered. One
      does not live alone or die alone in this world. There were your friends to
      consider."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And because I had no friends here, you were compelled to think for me!"
      answered Charley calmly. "Truth is, it was not a question of my friends,
      for what I was during those seven months, or what I am now, can make no
      difference to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked the Cure in the eyes steadily, and as though he would convey his
      intentions without words. The Curb understood. The habit of listening to
      the revelations of the human heart had given him something of that
      clairvoyance which can only be pursued by the primitive mind, unvexed by
      complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, then, as though you had not come to life again? It is as though
      you had no past, Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is that, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo suddenly turned and left the room, for he heard a step on the frosty
      snow without.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will remain here, Monsieur?" said the Cure. "I cannot tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure had the bravery of simple souls with a duty to perform. He
      fastened his eyes on Charley. "Monsieur, is there any reason why you
      should not stay here? I ask it now, man to man&mdash;not as a priest of my
      people, but as man to man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley did not answer for a moment. He was wondering how he should put
      his reply. But his look did not waver, and the Cure saw the honesty of the
      gaze. At length he replied: "If you mean, have I committed any crime which
      the law may punish?&mdash;I answer no, Monsieur. If you mean, have I
      robbed or killed, or forged&mdash;or wronged a woman as men wrong women?
      No. These, I take it, are the things that matter first. For the rest, you
      can think of me as badly as you will, or as well, for what I do henceforth
      is the only thing that really concerns the world, Monsieur le Cure."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure came forward and put out his hand with a kindly gesture.
      "Monsieur, you have suffered," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, never at all, Monsieur. Never for a moment, until I was dropped
      down here like a stone from a sling. I had life by the throat; now it has
      me there&mdash;that is all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not a Catholic, Monsieur?" asked the priest, almost pleadingly,
      and as though the question had been much on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure made no rejoinder. If he was not a Catholic, what matter what he
      was? If he was not a Catholic, were he Buddhist, pagan, or Protestant, the
      position for them personally was the same. "I am very sorry," he said
      gently. "I might have helped you had you been a Catholic."
    </p>
    <p>
      The eye-glass came like lightning to the eye, and a caustic, questioning
      phrase was on the tongue, but Charley stopped himself in time. For, apart
      from all else, this priest had been his friend in calamity, had acted with
      a charming sensibility. The eye-glass troubled the Cure, and the look on
      Charley's face troubled him still more, but it passed as Charley said, in
      a voice as simple as the Cure's own:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may still help me as you have already done. I give you my word, too"&mdash;strange
      that he touched his lips with his tongue as he did in the old days when
      his mind turned to Jean Jolicoeur's saloon&mdash;"that I will do nothing
      to cause regret for your humanity and&mdash;and Christian kindness." Again
      the tongue touched the lips&mdash;a wave of the old life had swept over
      him, the old thirst had rushed upon him. Perhaps it was the force of this
      feeling which made him add, with a curious energy, "I give you my word,
      Monsieur le Cure." At that moment the door opened and Jo entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M'sieu'," he said to Charley, "a registered parcel has come for you. It
      has been brought by the postmaster's daughter. She will give it to no one
      but yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley's face paled, and the Cure's was scarcely less pale. In Charley's
      mind was the question, Who had discovered his presence here? Was he not,
      then, to escape? Who should send him parcels through the post?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure was perturbed. Was he, then, to know who this man was&mdash;his
      name and history? Was the story of his life now to be told?
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley broke the silence. "Tell the girl to come in." Instantly
      afterwards the postmaster's daughter entered. The look of the girl's face,
      at once delicate and rosy with health, almost put the question of the
      letter out of his mind for an instant. Her dark eyes met his as he came
      forward with outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is addressed, as you will see, 'To the Sick Man at the House of Jo
      Portugais, at Vadrome Mountain.' Are you that person, Monsieur?" she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she handed the parcel, Charley's eyes scanned her face quickly. How did
      this habitant girl come by this perfect French accent, this refined
      manner? He did not know the handwriting on the parcel; he hastily tore it
      open. Inside were a few dozen small packets. Here also was a sheet of
      paper. He opened and read it quickly. It said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Monsieur, I am not sure that you have recovered your memory and your
   health, and I am also not sure that in such case you will thank me
   for my work. If you think I have done you an injury, pray accept my
   profound apologies. Monsieur, you have been a drunkard. If you
   would reverse the record now, these powders, taken at opportune
   moments, will aid you. Monsieur, with every expression of my good-
   will, and the hope that you will convey to me without reserve your
   feelings on this delicate matter, I append my address in Paris, and
   I have the honour to subscribe myself, with high consideration,
   Monsieur, yours faithfully,
                    MARCEL LOISEL.
</pre>
    <p>
      The others looked at him with varied feelings as he read. Curiosity,
      inquiry, expectation, were common to them all, but with each was a
      different personal feeling. The Cure's has been described. Jo Portugais'
      mind was asking if this meant that the man who had come into his life must
      now go out of it; and the girl was asking who was this mysterious man,
      like none she had ever seen or known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without hesitation Charley handed over the letter to the Cure, who took it
      with surprise, read it with amazement, and handed it back with a flush on
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Charley to the girl. "It is good of you to bring it all
      this way. May I ask&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is Mademoiselle Rosalie Evanturel," said the Cure smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am Charles Mallard," said Charley slowly. "Thank you. I will go now,
      Monsieur Mallard," the girl said, lifting her eyes to his face. He bowed.
      As she turned and went towards the door her eyes met his. She blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait, Mademoiselle; I will go back with you," said the Cure kindly. He
      turned to Charley and held out his hand. "God be with you, Monsieur&mdash;Charles,"
      he said. "Come and see me soon." Remembering that his brother had written
      that the man was a drunkard, his eyes had a look of pity. This was the
      man's own secret and his. It was a way to the man's heart; he would use
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the two went out of the door, the girl looked back. Charley was putting
      the surgeon's letter into the fire, and did not see her; yet she blushed
      again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. HOW CHARLEY WENT ADVENTURING AND WHAT HE FOUND
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week passed. Charley's life was running in a tiny circle, but his mind
      was compassing large revolutions. The events of the last few days had cut
      deep. His life had been turned upside down. All his predispositions had
      been suddenly brought to check, his habits turned upon the flank and
      routed, his mental postures flung into confusion. He had to start life
      again; but it could not be in the way of any previous travel of mind or
      body. The line of cleavage was sharp and wide, and the only connection
      with the past was in the long-reaching influence of evil habits, which
      crept from their coverts, now and again, to mock him as his old self had
      mocked life&mdash;to mock him and to tempt him. Through seven months of
      healthy life for his body, while brain and will were sleeping, the whole
      man had made long strides towards recreation. But with the renewal of will
      and mind the old weaknesses, roused by memory, began to emerge
      intermittently, as water rises from a spring. There was something terrible
      in this repetition of sensation&mdash;the law of habit answering to the
      machine-like throbbing of memory, as, a kaleidoscope turning, turning, its
      pictures pass a certain point at fixed intervals&mdash;an automatic
      recurrence. He found himself at times touching his lips with his tongue,
      and with this act came the dry throat, the hot eye, the restless hand
      feeling for a glass that eluded his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice in one week did this fever surge up in him, and it caught him in
      those moments when, exhausted by the struggle of his mind to adapt itself
      to the new conditions, his senses were delicately susceptible. Visions of
      Jolicoeur's saloon came to his mind's eye. With a singular separateness, a
      new-developed dual sense, he saw himself standing in the summer heat,
      looking over to the cool dark doorway of the saloon, and he caught again
      the smell of the fresh-drawn beer. He was conscious of watching himself do
      this and that, of seeing himself move here and there. He began to look
      upon Charley Steele as a man he had known&mdash;he, Charles Mallard, had
      known&mdash;while he had to suffer for what Charley Steele had done. Then,
      all at once, as he was thinking and dreaming and seeing, there would seize
      upon him the old appetite, coincident with the seizure of his brain by the
      old sense of cynicism at its worst&mdash;such a worst as had made him
      insult Jake Hough when the rough countryman was ready to take his part
      that wild night at the Cote Dorion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At such moments life became a conflict&mdash;almost a terror&mdash;for as
      yet he had not swung into line with the new order of things. In truth,
      there was no order of things; for one life was behind him and the new one
      was not yet decided upon, save that here he would stay&mdash;here out of
      the world, out of the game, far from old associations, cut off, and to be
      for ever cut off, from all that he had ever known or seen or felt or
      loved!... Loved! When did he ever love? If love was synonymous with
      unselfishness, with the desire to give greater than the desire to get,
      then he had never known love. He realised now that he had given Kathleen
      only what might be given across a dinner-table&mdash;the sensuous tribute
      of a temperament, passionate without true passion or faith or friendship.
      Kathleen had known that he gave her nothing worth the having; for in some
      meagre sense she knew what love was, and had given it meagrely, after her
      nature, to another man, preserving meanwhile the letter of the law,
      respecting that bond which he had shamed by his excesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen was now sitting at another man's table&mdash;no, probably at his
      own table&mdash;his, Charley Steele's own table in his own house&mdash;the
      house he had given her by deed of gift the day he died. Tom Fairing was
      sitting where he used to sit, talking across the table&mdash;not as he
      used to talk&mdash;looking into Kathleen's face as he had never looked. He
      was no more to them than a dark memory. "Well, why should I be more?" he
      asked himself. "I am dead, if not buried. They think me down among the
      fishes. My game is done; and when she gets older and understands life
      better, Kathleen will say, 'Poor Charley&mdash;he might have been
      anything!' She'll be sure to say that some day, for habit and memory go
      round in a circle and pass the same point again and again. For me&mdash;they
      take me by the throat&mdash;" He put his hand up as if to free his throat
      from a grip, his tongue touched his lips, his hands grew restless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It comes back on me like a fit of ague, this miserable thirst. If I were
      within sight of Jolicoeur's saloon, I should be drinking hard this minute.
      But I'm here, and&mdash;" His hand felt his pocket, and he took out the
      powders the great surgeon had sent him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He knew&mdash;how did he know that I was a drunkard? Does a man carry in
      his face the tale he would not tell? Jo says I didn't talk of the past,
      that I never had delirium, that I never said a word to suggest who I was,
      or where I came from. Then how did the doctor&mdash;man know? I suppose
      every particular habit carries its own signal, and the expert knows the
      ciphers." He opened the paper containing the powders, and looked round for
      water, then paused, folded the paper up, and put it in his pocket again.
      He went over to the window and looked out. His shoulders set square. "No,
      no, no, not a speck on my tongue!" he said. "What I can't do of my own
      will is not worth doing. It's too foolish, to yield to the shadow of an
      old appetite. I play this game alone&mdash;here in Chaudiere."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked out and down. The sweet sun of early spring was shining hard,
      and the snow was beginning to pack, to hang like a blanket on the
      branches, to lie like a soft coverlet over all the forest and the fields.
      Far away on the frozen river were saplings stuck up to show where the ice
      was safe&mdash;a long line of poles from shore to shore&mdash;and carioles
      were hurrying across to the village. Being market-day, the place was alive
      with the cheerful commerce of the habitant. The bell of the parish church
      was ringing. The sound of it came up distantly and peacefully. Charley
      drew a long breath, turned away to a pail of water, filled a dipper half
      full, and drank it off gaspingly. Then he returned to the window with a
      look of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That does it," he said. "The horrible thing is gone again&mdash;out of my
      brain and out of my throat."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood there, Jo came up the hill with a bundle in his arms. Charley
      watched him for a moment, half whimsically, half curiously. Yet he sighed
      once too as Portugais opened the door and came into the room. "Well done,
      Jo!" said he. "You have 'em?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, M'sieu'. A good suit, and I believe they'll fit. Old Trudel says
      it's the best suit he's made in a year. I'm afraid he'll not make many
      more suits, old Trudel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's very bad. When he goes there'll be no tailor&mdash;ah, old Trudel
      will be missed for sure, M'sieu'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo spread the clothes out on the table&mdash;a coat, waistcoat, and
      trousers of fulled cloth, grey and bulky, and smelling of the loom and the
      tailor's iron. Charley looked at them interestedly, then glanced at the
      clothes he had on, the suit that had belonged to him last year&mdash;grave-clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself up as though rousing from a dream. "Come, Jo, clear out,
      and you shall have your new habitant in a minute," he said. Portugais left
      the room, and when he came back, Charley was dressed in the suit of grey
      fulled cloth. It was loose, but comfortable, and save for the refined face&mdash;on
      which a beard was growing now&mdash;and the eye-glass, he might easily
      have passed for a farmer. When he put on the dog-skin fur cap and a small
      muffler round his neck, it was the costume of the habitant complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was no disguise, for it was part of the life that Charles Mallard,
      once Charley Steele, should lead henceforth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the door and opened it. "Good-bye, Portugais," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo was startled. "Where are you going, M'sieu'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the village."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What to do, M'sieu'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who knows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will come back?" Jo asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before sundown, Jo. Good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first long walk he had taken since he had become himself
      again. The sweet, cold air, with a bracing wind in his face, gave peace to
      the nerves but now strained and fevered in the fight with appetite. His
      mind cleared, and he drank in the sunny air and the pungent smell of the
      balsams. His feet light with moccasins, he even ran a distance, enjoying
      the glow from a fast-beating pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he came into the high-road, people passed him in carioles and sleighs.
      Some eyed him curiously. What did he mean to do? What object had he in
      coming to the village? What did he expect? As he entered the village his
      pace slackened. He had no destination, no object. He was simply aware that
      his new life was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed a little house on which was a sign, "Narcisse Dauphin, Notary."
      It gave him a curious feeling. It was the old life before him. "Charles
      Mallard, Notary?"&mdash;No, that was not for him. Everything that reminded
      him of the past, that brought him in touch with it, must be set aside. He
      moved on. Should he go to the Cure? No; one thing at a time, and today he
      wanted his thoughts for himself. More people passed him, and spoke of him
      to each other, though there was no coarse curiosity&mdash;the habitant has
      manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he passed a low shop with a divided door. The lower half was
      closed, the upper open, and the winter sun was shining full into the room,
      where a bright fire burned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley looked up. Over the door was painted, in straggling letters:
      "Louis Trudel, Tailor." He looked inside. There, on a low table, bent over
      his work, with a needle in his hand, sat Louis Trudel the tailor. Hearing
      footsteps, feeling a shadow, he looked up. Charley started at the look of
      the shrunken, yellow face; for if ever death had set his seal, it was on
      that haggard parchment. The tailor's yellow eyes ran from Charley's face
      to his clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew they'd fit," he said, with a snarl. "Drove me hard, too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley had an inspiration. He opened the halfdoor, and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want help?" he said, fixing his eyes on the tailor's, steady and
      persistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the good of wanting&mdash;I can't get it," was the irritable
      reply, as he uncrossed his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley took the iron out of his hand. "I'll press, if you'll show me
      how," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want a fiddling ten-minutes' help like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't fiddling. I'm going to stay, if you think I'll do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to stop-every day?" The old man's voice quavered a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely that." Charley wetted a seam with water as he had often seen
      tailors do. He dropped the hot iron on the seam, and sniffed with
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you?" said the tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man who wants work. The Cure knows. It's all right. Shall I stay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The tailor nodded, and sat down with a colour in his face.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. ROSALIE, CHARLEY, AND THE MAN THE WIDOW PLOMONDON JILTED
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the moment there came to the post-office the letter addressed to "The
      Sick Man at the House of Jo Portugais at Vadrome Mountain," Rosalie
      Evanturel dreamed dreams. Mystery, so fascinating a thing in all the
      experiences of life, took hold of her. The strange man in the lonely hut
      on the hill, the bandaged head, the keen, piercing blue eyes, the monocle,
      like a masked battery of the mind, levelled at her&mdash;all appealed to
      that life she lived apart from the people with whom she had daily
      commerce. Her world was a world of books and dreams, and simple, practical
      duties of life. Most books were romance to her, for most were of a life to
      which she had not been educated. Even one or two purely Protestant books
      of missionary enterprise, found in a box in her dead mother's room, had
      had all the charms of poetry and adventure. It was all new, therefore all
      delightful, even when the Protestant sentiments shocked her as being not
      merely untrue, but hurting that aesthetic sense never remote from the mind
      of the devout Catholic.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had blushed when monsieur had first looked at her, in the hut on
      Vadrome Mountain, not because there was any soft sentiment about him in
      her heart&mdash;how could there be for a man she had but just seen!&mdash;but
      because her feelings, her imagination, were all at high temperature;
      because the man compelled attention. The feeling sprang from a deep
      sensibility, a natural sense, not yet made incredulous by the ironies of
      life. These had never presented themselves to her in a country, in a
      parish, where people said of fortune and misfortune, happiness and sorrow,
      "C'est le bon Dieu!"&mdash;always "C'est le bon Dieu!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In some sense it was a pity that she had brains above the ordinary, that
      she had had a good education and nice tastes. It was the cultivation of
      the primitive and idealistic mind, which could not rationalise a sense of
      romance, of the altruistic, by knowledge of life. As she sat behind the
      post-office counter she read all sorts of books that came her way. When
      she learned English so as to read it almost as easily as she read French,
      her greatest joy was to pore over Shakespeare, with a heart full of
      wonder, and, very often, eyes full of tears&mdash;so near to the eyes of
      her race. Her imagination inhabited Chaudiere with a different folk,
      living in homes very unlike these wide, sweeping-roofed structures, with
      double windows and clean-scrubbed steps, tall doors, and wide, uncovered
      stoops. Her people&mdash;people of bright dreaming&mdash;were not
      quarrelsome, or childish, or merely traditional, like the habitants. They
      were picturesque and able and simple, doing good things in disguise,
      succouring distress, yielding their lives without thought for a cause, or
      a woman, and loving with an undying love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley was of these people&mdash;from the first instant she saw him. The
      Cure, the Avocat, and the Seigneur were also of them, but placidly,
      unimportantly. "The Sick Man at Jo Portugais' House" came out of a
      mysterious distance. Something in his eyes said, "I have seen, I have
      known," told her that when he spoke she would answer freely, that they
      were kinsfolk in some hidden way. Her nature was open and frank; she lived
      upon the house-tops, as it were, going in and out of the lives of the
      people of Chaudiere with neighbourly sympathy and understanding. Yet she
      knew that she was not of them, and they knew that, poor as she was, in her
      veins flowed the blood of the old nobility of France. For this the Cure
      could vouch. Her official position made her the servant of the public, and
      she did her duty with naturalness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been a figure in the parish ever since the day she returned from
      the convent at Quebec, and took her dead mother's place in the home and
      the parish. She had a quick temper, but there was not a cheerless note in
      her nature, and there was scarce a dog or a horse in the parish but knew
      her touch, and responded to it. Squirrels ate out of her hand, she had
      even tamed two partridges, and she kept in her little garden a bear she
      had brought up from a cub. Her devotion to her crippled father was in
      keeping with her quick response to every incident of sorrow or joy in the
      parish&mdash;only modified by wilful prejudices scarcely in keeping with
      her unselfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Flynn, the Seigneur's Irish cook, said of her: "Shure, she's not
      made all av wan piece, the darlin'! She'll wear like silk, but she's not
      linen for everybody's washin'." And Mrs. Flynn knew a thing or two, as was
      conceded by all in Chaudiere. No gossip was Mrs. Flynn, but she knew well
      what was going on in the parish, and she had strong views upon all
      subjects, and a special interest in the welfare of two people in
      Chaudiere. One of these was the Seigneur, who, when her husband died,
      leaving behind him a name for wit and neighbourliness, and nothing else,
      proposed that she should come to be his cook. In spite of her protest that
      what was "fit for Teddy was not fit for a gintleman of quality," the
      Seigneur had had his way, never repenting of his choice. Mrs. Flynn's
      cooking was not her only good point. She had the rarest sense and an
      unfailing spring of good-nature&mdash;life bubbled round her. It was she
      that had suggested the crippled M. Evanturel to the Seigneur when the
      office of postmaster became vacant, and the Seigneur had acted on her
      suggestion, henceforth taking greater interest in Rosalie.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Flynn who gave Rosalie information concerning Charley's
      arrival at the shop of Louis Trudel the tailor. The morning after Charley
      came, Mrs. Flynn had called for a waistcoat of the Seigneur, who was
      expected home from a visit to Quebec. She found Charley standing at a
      table pressing seams, and her quick eye took him in with knowledge and
      instinct. She was the one person, save Rosalie, who could always divert
      old Louis, and this morning she puckered his sour face with amusement by
      the story of the courtship of the widow Plomondon and Germain Boily the
      horse-trainer, whose greatest gift was animal-training, and greatest
      weakness a fondness for widows, temporary and otherwise. Before she left
      the shop, with the stranger's smile answering to her nod, she had made up
      her mind that Charley was a tailor by courtesy only. So she told Rosalie a
      few moments afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis a man, darlin', that's seen the wide wurruld. 'Tis himisperes he
      knows, not parrishes. Fwhat's he doin' here, I dun'no'. Fwhere's he come
      from, I dun'no'. French or English, I dun'no'. But a gintleman born, I
      know. 'Tis no tailor, darlin', but tailorin' he'll do as aisy as he'll do
      a hunderd other things anny day. But how he shlipped in here, an' when he
      shlipped in here, an' what's he come for, an' how long he's stayin', an'
      meanin' well, or doin' ill, I dun'no', darlin', I dun' no'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think he'll do ill, Mrs. Flynn," said Rosalie, in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' if ye haven't seen him, how d'ye know?" asked Mrs. Flynn, taking a
      pinch of snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have seen him&mdash;but not in the tailor-shop. I saw him at Jo
      Portugais' a fortnight ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aisy, aisy, darlin'. At Jo Portugais'&mdash;that's a quare place for a
      stranger. 'Tis not wid Jo's introducshun I'd be comin' to Chaudiere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He comes with the Cure's introduction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' how d'ye know that, darlin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Curb was at Jo Portugais' with monsieur when I went there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wint there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To take him a letter&mdash;the stranger." "What's his name, darlin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The letter I took him was addressed, 'To the Sick Man at Jo Portugais'
      House at Vadrome Mountain.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, thin, the Cure knows. 'Tis some rich man come to get well, and plays
      at bein' tailor. But why didn't the letther come to his name, I wander
      now? That's what I wander."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie shook her head, and looked reflectively through the window towards
      the tailor-shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How manny times have ye seen him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only once;" answered Rosalie truthfully. She did not, however, tell Mrs.
      Flynn that she had thrice walked nearly to Vadrome Mountain in the hope of
      seeing him again; and that she had gone to her favourite resort, the Rest
      of the Flax-Beaters, lying in the way of the riverpath from Vadrome
      Mountain, on the chance of his passing. She did not tell Mrs. Flynn that
      there had scarcely been a waking hour when she had not thought of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What Portugais knows, he'll not be tellin'," said Mrs. Flynn, after a
      moment. "An' 'tis no business of ours, is it, darlin'? Shure, there's Jo
      comin' out of the tailor-shop now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They both looked out of the window, and saw Jo encounter Filion Lacasse
      the saddler, and Maximilian Cour the baker. The three stood in the middle
      of the street for a minute, Jo talking freely. He was usually morose and
      taciturn, but now he spoke as though eager to unburden his mind&mdash;Charley
      and he had agreed upon what should be said to the people of Chaudiere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the confidences among the three was too much for Mrs. Flynn.
      She opened the door of the post office and called to Jo. "Like three crows
      shtandin' there!" she said. "Come in&mdash;ma'm'selle says come in, and
      tell your tales here, if they're fit to hear, Jo Portugais. Who are you to
      say no when ma'm'selle bids!" she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon afterwards Jo was inside the post-office, telling his tale with
      the deliberation of a lesson learned by heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right, as ma'm'selle knows," he said. "The Cure was there when
      ma'm'selle brought a letter to M'sieu' Mallard. The Cure knows all.
      M'sieu' come to my house sick-and he stayed there. There is nothing like
      the pine-trees and the junipers to cure some things. He was with me very
      quiet some time. The Cure come and come. He knows. When m'sieu' got well,
      he say, 'I will not go from Chaudiere; I will stay. I am poor, and I will
      earn my bread here.' At first, when he is getting well, he is
      carpent'ring. He makes cupboards and picture-frames. The Cure has one of
      the cupboards in the sacristy; the frames he puts on the Stations of the
      Cross in the church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good enough for me!" said Maximilian Cour. "Did he make them for
      nothing?" asked Filion Lacasse solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one cent did he ask. What's more, he's working for Louis Trudel for
      nothing. He come through the village yesterday; he see Louis old and sick
      on his bench, and he set down and go to work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good enough for me," said the saddler. "If a man work for the
      Church for nothing, he is a Christian. If he work for Louis Trudel for
      nothing, he is a fool&mdash;first-class&mdash;or a saint. I wouldn't work
      for Louis Trudel if he give me five dollars a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tiens! the man that work for Louis Trudel work for the Church, for all
      old Louis makes goes to the Church in the end&mdash;that is his will. The
      Notary knows," said Maximilian Cour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See there, now," interposed Mrs. Flynn, pointing across the street to the
      tailor-shop. "Look at that grocer-man stickin' in his head; and there's
      Magloire Cadoret and that pig of a barber, Moise Moisan, starin' through
      the dure, an'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, the barber and his companion suddenly turned their faces to
      the street, and started forward with startled exclamations, the grocer
      following. They all ran out from the post-office. Not far up the street a
      crowd was gathering. Rosalie locked the office-door and followed the
      others quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the Hotel Trois Couronnes a painful thing was happening.
      Germain Boily, the horse-trainer, fresh from his disappointment with the
      widow Plomondon, had driven his tamed moose up to the Trois Couronnes, and
      had drunk enough whiskey to make him ill-tempered. He had then begun to
      "show off" the animal, but the savage instincts of the moose being roused,
      he had attacked his master, charging with wide-branching horns, and
      striking with his feet. Boily was too drunk to fight intelligently. He
      went down under the hoofs of the enraged animal, as his huge boar-hound,
      always with him, fastened on the moose's throat, dragged him to the
      ground, and tore gaping wounds in his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all the work of a moment. People ran from the doorways and
      sidewalks, but stayed at a comfortable distance until the moose was
      dragged down; then they made to approach the insensible man. Before any
      one could reach him, however, the great hound, with dripping fangs, rushed
      to his master's body, and, standing over it, showed his teeth savagely.
      The hotel-keeper approached, but the bristles of the hound stood up, he
      prepared to attack, and the landlord drew back in haste. Then M. Dauphin,
      the Notary, who had joined the crowd, held out a hand coaxingly, and with
      insinuating rhetoric drew a little nearer than the landlord had done; but
      he retreated precipitously as the hound crouched back for a spring. Some
      one called for a gun, and Filion Lacasse ran into his shop. The animal had
      now settled down on his master's body, his bloodshot eyes watching in
      menace. The one chance seemed to be to shoot him, and there must be no
      bungling, lest his prostrate master suffer at the same time. The crowd had
      melted away into the houses, and were now standing at doorways and
      windows, ready for instant retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filion Lacasse's gun was now at disposal, but who would fire it? Jo
      Portugais was an expert shot, and he reached out a hand for the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did so, Rosalie Evanturel cried: "Wait, oh, wait!" Before any one
      could interfere she moved along the open space to the mad beast, speaking
      soothingly, and calling his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd held their breath. A woman fainted. Some wrung their hands, and
      Jo Portugais, with blanched face, stood with gun half raised. With assured
      kindness of voice and manner, Rosalie walked deliberately over to the
      hound. At first the animal's bristles came up, and he prepared to spring,
      but murmuring to him, she held out her hand, and presently laid it on his
      huge head. With a growl of subjection, the dog drew from the body of his
      master, and licked Rosalie's fingers as she knelt beside Boily and felt
      his heart. She put her arm round the dog's neck, and said to the crowd,
      "Some one come&mdash;only one&mdash;ah, yes, you, Monsieur!" she added, as
      Charley, who had just arrived on the scene, came forward. "Only you, if
      you can lift him. Take him to my house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her arm still round the dog, she talked to him, as Charley came forward,
      and, lifting up the body of the little horse-trainer, drew him across his
      shoulder. The hound at first resented the act, but under Rosalie's touch
      became quiet, and followed at their heels towards the post-office, licking
      the wounded man's hands as they hung down. Inside M. Evanturel's house the
      injured man was laid upon a couch. Charley examined his wounds, and,
      finding them severe, advised that the Cure be sent for, while he and Jo
      Portugais set about restoring him to consciousness. Jo had skill of a
      sort, and his crude medicaments were efficacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Cure came, the injured man was handed over to his care, and he
      arranged that in the evening Boily should be removed to his house, to
      await the arrival of the doctor from the next parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Charley's public introduction to the people of Chaudiere, and it
      was his second meeting with Rosalie Evanturel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident brought him into immediate prominence. Before he left the
      post-office, Filion Lacasse, Maximilian Cour, and Mrs. Flynn had given
      forth his history, as related by Jo Portugais. The village was agog with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      But attention was not centred on himself, for Rosalie's courage had set
      the parish talking. When the Notary stood on the steps of the saddler's
      shop, and with fine rhetoric proposed a vote of admiration for the girl,
      the cheering could be heard inside the post-office, and it brought Mrs.
      Flynn outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis for her, the darlin'&mdash;for Ma'm'selle Rosalie&mdash;they're
      splittin' their throats!" she said to Charley as he was making his way
      from the sick man's room to the street door. "Did ye iver see such an eye
      an' hand? That avil baste that's killed two Injins already&mdash;an' all
      the men o' the place sneakin' behind dures, an' she walkin' up cool as
      leaf in mornin' dew, an' quietin' the divil's own! Did ye iver see
      annything like it, sir&mdash;you that's seen so much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, it is not touch of hand alone, or voice alone," answered Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shure, 'tis somethin' kin in baste an' maid, you're manin' thin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so, Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simple like, an' understandin' what Noah understood in that ark av his&mdash;for
      talk to the bastes he must have, explainin' what was for thim to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like that, Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thrue for you, sir, 'tis as you say. There's language more than tongue of
      man can shpake. But listen, thin, to me"&mdash;her voice got lower&mdash;"for
      'tis not the furst time, a thing like that, the lady she is&mdash;granddaughter
      of a Seigneur, and descinded from nobility in France! 'Tis not the furst
      time to be doin' brave things. Just a shlip of a girl she was, three years
      ago, afther her mother died, an' she was back from convint. A woman come
      to the parish an' was took sick in the house of her brother&mdash;from
      France she was. Small-pox they said at furst. 'Twas no small-pox, but
      plague, got upon the seas. Alone she was in the house&mdash;her brother
      left her alone, the black-hearted coward. The people wouldn't go near the
      place. The Cure was away. Alone the woman was&mdash;poor soul! Who wint&mdash;who
      wint and cared for her? Who do ye think, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None other. 'Go tell Mrs. Flynn,' says she, 'to care for my father till I
      come back,' an' away she wint to the house of plague. A week she stayed,
      an' no one wint near her. Alone she was with the woman and the plague.
      'Lave her be,' said the Cure when he come back; ''tis for the love of God.
      God is with her&mdash;lave her be, and pray for her,' says he. An' he wint
      himself, but she would not let him in. ''Tis my work,' says she. ''Tis
      God's work for me to do,' says she. 'An' the woman will live if 'tis God's
      will,' says she. 'There's an agnus dei on her breast,' says she. 'Go an'
      pray,' says she. Pray the Cure did, an' pray did we all, but the woman
      died of the plague. All alone did Rosalie draw her to the grave on a
      stone-boat down the lane, an' over the hill, an' into the churchyard. An'
      buried her with her own hands at night, no one knowin' till the mornin',
      she did. So it was. An' the burial over, she wint back an' burned the
      house to the ground&mdash;sarve the villain right that lave the sick woman
      alone! An' her own clothes she burned, an' put on the clothes I brought
      her wid me own hand. An' for that thing she did, the love o' God in her
      heart, is it for Widdy Flynn or Cure or anny other to forgit? Shure the
      Cure was for iver broken-hearted, for that he was sick abed for days an'
      could not go to the house when the woman died, an' say to Rosalie, 'Let me
      in for her last hour.' But the word of Rosalie&mdash;shure 'twas as good
      as the words of a praste, savin' the Cure prisince wheriver he may be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the story of Rosalie which Mrs. Flynn told Charley, as he stood
      at the street door of the post-office. When she had finished, Charley went
      back into the room where Rosalie sat beside the sick man's couch, the
      hound at her feet. She came forward, surprised, for he had bade her
      good-bye but a few minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I sit and watch for an hour longer, Mademoiselle?" he said. "You will
      have your duties in the post-office."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur&mdash;it is good of you," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two hours Charley watched her going in and out, whispering directions
      to Mrs. Flynn, doing household duty, bringing warmth in with her, and
      leaving light behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was afternoon when he returned to his bench in the tailor-shop, and was
      received by old Louis Trudel in peevish silence. For an hour they worked
      in silence, and then the tailor said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A brave girl&mdash;that. We will work till nine to-night!"

      CHAPTER XV. THE MARK IN THE PAPER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Chaudiere was nearing the last of its nine-days' wonder. It had filed past
      the doorway of the tailor-shop; it had loitered on the other side of the
      street; it had been measured for more clothes than in three months past&mdash;that
      it might see Charley at work in the shop, cross-legged on a bench, or
      wielding the goose, his eye glass in his eye. Here was sensation indeed,
      for though old M. Rossignol, the Seigneur, had an eye-glass, it was held
      to his eye&mdash;a large bone-bound thing with a little gold handle; but
      no one in Chaudiere had ever worn a glass in his eye like that. Also, no
      one in Chaudiere had ever looked quite like "M'sieu'"&mdash;for so it was
      that, after the first few days (a real tribute to his importance and sign
      of the interest he created) Charley came to be called "M'sieu'," and the
      Mallard was at last entirely dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently people came and stood at the tailor's door and talked, or
      listened to Louis Trudel and M'sieu' talking. And it came to be noised
      abroad that the stranger talked as well as the Cure and better than the
      Notary. By-and-by they associated his eye-glass with his talent, so that
      it seemed, as it were, to be the cause of it. Yet their talk was ever of
      simple subjects, of everyday life about them, now and then of politics,
      occasionally of the events of the world filtered to them through vast
      tracts of country. There was one subject which, however, was barred;
      perhaps because there was knowledge abroad that M'sieu' was not a
      Catholic, perhaps because Charley himself adroitly changed the
      conversation when it veered that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the parish had not quite made up its mind about him, there were a
      number of things in his favour. In the first place, the Cure seemed
      satisfied; secondly, he minded his own business. Also, he was working for
      Louis Trudel for nothing. These things Jo Portugais diligently impressed
      on the minds of all who would listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      From above the frosted part of the windows of the post-office, in the
      corner where she sorted letters, Rosalie could look over at the tailor's
      shop at an angle; could sometimes even see M'sieu' standing at the long
      table with a piece of chalk, a pair of shears, or a measure. She watched
      the tailor-shop herself, but it annoyed her when she saw any one else do
      so. She resented&mdash;she was a woman and loved monopoly&mdash;all
      inquiry regarding M'sieu', so frequently addressed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, as Charley came out, on his way to the house on Vadrome
      Mountain, she happened to be outside. He saw her, paused, lifted his fur
      cap, and crossed the street to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you, perhaps, paper, pens, and ink for sale, Mademoiselle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, oh yes; come in, Monsieur Mallard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, it is nice of you to remember me," he answered. "I see you every day&mdash;often,"
      she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, we are neighbours," he responded. "The man&mdash;the
      horse-trainer&mdash;is quite well again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has gone home almost well," she answered. She placed pens, paper, and
      ink before him. "Will these do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly," he answered mechanically, and laid a few pens and a bottle of
      ink beside the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were very brave that day," he said&mdash;they had not talked together
      since, though seeing each other so often.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no; I knew he would make friends with me&mdash;the hound."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," he rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We should show animals that we trust them," she said, in some confusion,
      for being near him made her heart throb painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer. Presently his eye glanced at the paper again, and was
      arrested. He ran his fingers over it, and a curious look flashed across
      his face. He held the paper up to the light quickly, and looked through
      it. It was thin, half-foreign paper, without lines, and there was a
      water-mark in it-large, shadowy, filmy&mdash;Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was paper made in the mills which had belonged to Kathleen's uncle.
      This water-mark was made to celebrate their marriage-day. Only for one
      year had this paper been made, and then the trade in it was stopped. It
      had gone its ways down the channels of commerce, and here it was in his
      hand, a reminder, not only of the old life, but, as it were, the parchment
      for the new. There it was, a piece of plain good paper, ready for pen and
      ink and his letter to the Cure's brother in Paris&mdash;the only letter he
      would ever write, ever again until he died, so he told himself; but hold
      it up to the light and there was the name over which his letter must be
      written&mdash;Kathleen, invisible but permanent, obscured, but brought to
      life by the raising of a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl caught the flash of feeling in his face, saw him holding the
      paper up to the light, and then, with an abstracted air, calmly lay it
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will do, thank you," he said. "Give me the whole packet." She
      wrapped it up for him without a word, and he laid down a two-dollar note,
      the last he had in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much of this paper have you?" he asked. The girl looked under the
      counter. "Six packets," she said. "Six, and a few sheets over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will take it all. But keep it for me, for a week, or perhaps a
      fortnight, will you?" He did not need all this paper to write letters
      upon, yet he meant to buy all the paper of this sort that the shop
      contained. But he must get money from Louis Trudel&mdash;he would speak
      about it to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur does not want me to sell even the loose sheets?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I like the paper, and I will take it all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart was beating hard. All this man did had peculiar significance to
      her. His look seemed to say: "Do not fear. I will tell you things."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him the parcel and the change, and he turned to go. "You read
      much?" he asked, almost casually, yet deeply interested in the charm and
      intelligence of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes, Monsieur," she answered quickly. "I am always reading."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak at once. He was wondering whether, in this primitive
      place, such a mind and nature would be the wiser for reading; whether it
      were not better to be without a mental aspiration, which might set up
      false standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you reading now?" he asked, with his hand on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Antony and Cleopatra, also Enoch Arden," she answered, in good English,
      and without accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head turned quickly towards her, but he did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enoch Arden is terrible," she added eagerly. "Don't you think so,
      Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very painful," he answered. "Good-night." He opened the door and
      went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran to the door and watched him go down the street. For a little she
      stood thinking, then, turning to the counter, and snatching up a sheet of
      the paper he had bought, held it up to the light. She gave a cry of
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kathleen!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought of the start he gave when he looked at the water-mark; she
      thought of the look on his face when he said he would buy all this paper
      she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was Kathleen?" she whispered, as though she was afraid some one would
      hear. "Who was Kathleen!" she said again resentfully.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. MADAME DAUPHIN HAS A MISSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day Charley began to know the gossip of the village about him from a
      source less friendly than Jo Portugais. The Notary's wife, bringing her
      boy to be measured for a suit of broadcloth, asked Charley if the things
      Jo had told about him were true, and if it was also true that he was a
      Protestant, and perhaps an Englishman. As yet, Charley had been asked no
      direct questions, for the people of Chaudiere had the consideration of
      their temperament; but the Notary's wife was half English, and being a
      figure in the place, she took to herself more privileges than did old
      Madame Dugal, the Cure's sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her ill-disguised impertinence in English, as bad as her French and as
      fluent, Charley listened with quiet interest. When she had finished her
      voluble statement she said, with a simper and a sneer-for, after all, a
      Notary's wife must keep her position&mdash;"And now, what is the truth
      about it? And are you a Protestant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sinister look in old Trudel's eyes as, cross-legged on his
      table, he listened to Madame Dauphin. He remembered the time, twenty-five
      years ago, when he had proposed to this babbling woman, and had been
      rejected with scorn&mdash;to his subsequent satisfaction; for there was no
      visible reason why any one should envy the Notary, in his house or out of
      it. Already Trudel had a respect for the tongue of M'sieu'. He had not
      talked much the few days he had been in the shop, but, as the old man had
      said to Filion Lacasse the saddler, his brain was like a pair of shears&mdash;it
      went clip, clip, clip right through everything. He now hoped that his new
      apprentice, with the hand of a master-workman, would go clip, clip through
      madame's inquisitiveness. He was not disappointed, for he heard Charley
      say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "One person in the witness-box at a time, Madame. Till Jo Portugais is
      cross-examined and steps down, I don't see what I can do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are a Protestant!" said the woman snappishly. This man was only a
      tailor, dressed in fulled cloth, and no doubt his past life would not bear
      inspection; and she was the Notary's wife, and had said to people in the
      village that she would find out the man's history from himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is one good reason why I should not go to confession," he replied
      casually, and turned to a table where he had been cutting a waistcoat&mdash;for
      the first time in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think I'm going to stand your impertinence? Do you know who I am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley calmly put up his monocle. He looked at the foolish little woman
      with so cruel a flash of the eye that she shrank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should know you anywhere," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Stephan," she said nervously to her boy, and pulled him towards the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the instant Charley's feeling changed. Was he then going to carry the
      old life into the new, and rebuke a silly garish woman whose faults were
      generic more than personal? He hurried forward to the door and courteously
      opened it for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Permit me, Madame," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that there was nothing ironical in this politeness. She had a
      sudden apprehension of an unusual quality called "the genteel," for no
      storekeeper in Chaudiere ever opened or shut a shop-door for anybody. She
      smiled a vacuous smile; she played "the lady" terribly, as, with a curious
      conception of dignity, she held her body stiff as a ramrod, and with a
      prim merci sailed into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gorgeous exit changed her opinion of the man she had been unable to
      catechise. Undoubtedly he had snubbed her&mdash;that was the word she used
      in her mind&mdash;but his last act had enabled her, in the sight of
      several habitants and even of Madame Dugal, "to put on airs," as the
      charming Madame Dugal said afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking it better to give the impression that she had had a successful
      interview, she shook her head mysteriously when asked about M'sieu', and
      murmured, "He is quite the gentleman!" which she thought a socially
      distinguished remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone, Charley turned to old Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to turn your customers away," he said quietly, "but there it
      is! I don't need to answer questions as a part of the business, do I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sour grin on the face of old Trudel. He grunted some inaudible
      answer, then, after a pause, added: "I'd have been hung for murder, if
      she'd answered the question I asked her once as I wanted her to."
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened and shut his shears with a sardonic gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley smiled, and went to the window. For a minute he stood watching
      Madame Dauphin and Rosalie at the post-office door. The memory of his talk
      with Rosalie was vivid to him at the moment. He was thinking also that he
      had not a penny in the world to pay for the rest of the paper he had
      bought. He turned round and put on his coat slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing that for?" asked the old man, with a kind of snarl,
      yet with trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I'll work any more to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not work! Smoke of the devil, isn't Sunday enough to play in? You're not
      put out by that fool wife of Dauphin's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no&mdash;not that! I want an understanding about wages."
    </p>
    <p>
      To Louis the dread crisis had come. He turned a little green, for he was
      very miserly-for the love of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely realised what was happening when Charley first sat down on
      the bench beside him. He had been taken by surprise. Apart from the
      excitement of the new experience, he had profited by the curiosity of the
      public, for he had orders enough to keep him busy until summer, and he had
      had to give out work to two extra women in the parish, though he had never
      before had more than one working for him. But his ruling passion was
      strong in him. He always remembered with satisfaction that once when the
      Cure was absent and he was supposed to be dying, a priest from another
      parish came, and, the ministrations over, he had made an offering of a
      gold piece. When the young priest hesitated, his fingers had crept back to
      the gold piece, closed on it, and drawn it back beneath the coverlet
      again. He had then peacefully fallen asleep. It was a gracious memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't need much, I don't want a great deal," continued Charley when the
      tailor did not answer, "but I have to pay for my bed and board, and I
      can't do it on nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How have you done it so far?" peevishly replied the tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By working after hours at carpentering up there"&mdash;he made a gesture
      towards Vadrome Mountain. "But I can't go on doing that all the time, or
      I'll be like you too soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be like me!" The voice of the tailor rose shrilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be like me! What's the matter with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only that you're in a bad way before your time, and that you mayn't get
      out of this hole without stepping into another. You work too hard,
      Monsieur Trudel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want&mdash;wages?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley inclined his head. "If you think I'm worth them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tailor viciously snipped a piece of cloth. "How can I pay you wages,
      if you stand there doing nothing?" "This is my day for doing nothing,"
      Charley answered pleasantly, for the tailor-man amused him, and the
      whimsical mental attitude of his past life was being brought to the
      surface by this odd figure, with big spectacles pushed up on a yellow
      forehead, and shrunken hands viciously clutching the shears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to say you're not going to work to-day, and this suit of
      clothes promised for to-morrow night&mdash;for the Manor House too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a piece of chalk Charley idly made heads on brown paper. "After all,
      why should clothes be the first thing in one's mind&mdash;when they are
      some one else's! It's a beautiful day outside. I've never felt the sun so
      warm and the air so crisp and sweet&mdash;never in all my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then where have you lived?" snapped out the tailor with a sneer. "You
      must be a Yankee&mdash;they have only what we leave over down there!"&mdash;he
      jerked his head southward. "We don't stop to look at weather here. I
      suppose you did where you come from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley smiled in a distant sort of way. "Where I came from, when we
      weren't paid for our work we always stopped to consider our health&mdash;and
      the weather. I don't want a great deal. I put it to you honestly. Do you
      want me? If you do, will you give me enough to live on&mdash;enough to buy
      a suit of clothes a year, to pay for food and a room? If I work for you
      for nothing, I have to live on others for nothing, or kill myself as
      you're doing."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer at once, and Charley went on: "I came to you because I
      saw you wanted help badly. I saw that you were hard-pushed and sick&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wasn't sick," interrupted the tailor with a snarl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, overworked, which is the same thing in the end. I did the best I
      could: I gave you my hands&mdash;awkward enough they were at first, I
      know, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a lie. They weren't awkward," churlishly cut in the tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps they weren't so awkward, but they didn't know quite what to
      do&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knew as well as if you'd been taught," came back in a growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I wasn't awkward, and I had a knack for the work. What was
      more, I wanted work. I wanted to work at the first thing that appealed to
      me. I had no particular fancy for tailoring&mdash;you get bowlegged in
      time!"&mdash;the old spirit was fighting with the new&mdash;"but here you
      were at work, and there I was idle, and I had been ill, and some one who
      wasn't responsible for me&mdash;a stranger-worked for me and cared for me.
      Wasn't it natural, when you were playing the devil with yourself, that I
      should step in and give you a hand? You've been better since&mdash;isn't
      that so?" The tailor did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can't go on as we are, though I want only enough to keep me going,"
      Charley continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I don't give you what you want, you'll leave?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I'm never going to leave you. I'm going to stay here, for you'll
      never get another man so cheap; and it suits me to stay&mdash;you need
      some one to look after you."
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious soft look suddenly flashed into the tailor's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you take on the business after I'm gone?" he asked at last. "It's
      along time to look ahead, I know," he added quickly, for not in words
      would he acknowledge the possibility of the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think so," Charley answered, his eyes on the bright sun and the
      soft snow on the trees beyond the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tailor snatched up a pattern and figured on it for a moment. Then he
      handed it to Charley. "Will that do?" he asked with anxious, acquisitive
      look, his yellow eyes blinking hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley looked at it musingly, then said "Yes, if you give me a room
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I meant board and lodging too," said Louis Trudel with an outburst of
      eager generosity, for, as it was, he had offered about one-half of what
      Charley was worth to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley nodded. "Very well, that will do," he said, and took off his coat
      and went to work. For a long time they worked silently. The tailor was in
      great good-humour; for the terrible trial was over, and he now had an
      assistant who would be a better tailor than himself. There would be more
      profit, more silver nails for the church door, and more masses for his
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Cure says you are all right.... When will you come here?" he said at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow night I shall sleep here," answered Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was arranged that Charley should come to live in the tailor's house,
      to sleep in the room which the tailor had provided for a wife twenty-five
      years before&mdash;even for her that was now known as Madame Dauphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      All morning the tailor chuckled to himself. When they sat down at noon to
      a piece of venison which Charley had prepared himself&mdash;taking the
      frying-pan out of the hands of Margot Patry, the old servant, and cooking
      it to a turn&mdash;Louis Trudel saw his years lengthen to an indefinite
      period. He even allowed himself to nervously stand up, bow, shake
      Charley's hand jerkingly, and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "M'sieu', I care not what you are or where you come from, or even if
      you're a Protestant, perhaps an Englishman. You're a gentleman and a
      tailor, and old Louis Trudel will not forget you. It shall be as you said
      this morning&mdash;it is no day for work. We will play, and the clothes
      for the Manor can go to the devil. Smoke of hell-fire, I will go and have
      a pipe with that, poor wretch the Notary!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So, a wonderful thing happened. Louis Trudel, on a week-day and a
      market-day, went to smoke a pipe with Narcisse Dauphin, and to tell him
      that M. Mallard was going to stay with him for ever, at fine wages. He
      also announced that he had paid this whole week's wages in advance; but he
      did not tell what he did not know&mdash;that half the money had already
      been given to old Margot, whose son lay ill at home with a broken leg, and
      whose children were living on bread and water. Charley had slowly drawn
      from the woman the story of her life as he sat by the kitchen fire and
      talked to her, while her master was talking to the Notary.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. THE TAILOR MAKES A MIDNIGHT FORAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since the day Charley had brought home the paper bought at the
      post-office, and water-marked Kathleen, he had, at odd times, written down
      his thoughts, and promptly torn the paper up again or put it in the fire.
      In the repression of the new life, in which he must live wholly alone, so
      far as all past habits of mind were concerned, it was a relief to record
      his passing reflections, as he had been wont to do when the necessity for
      it was less. Writing them here was like the bursting of an imprisoned
      stream; it was relaxing the ceaseless eye of vigilance; freeing an
      imprisoned personality. This personality was not yet merged into that
      which must take its place, must express itself in the involuntary acts
      which tell of a habit of mind and body&mdash;no longer the imitative and
      the histrionic, but the inherent and the real.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the afternoon of the day that old Louis agreed to give him wages, and
      went to smoke a pipe with the Notary, Charley scribbled down his thoughts
      on this matter of personality and habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who knows," he wrote, "which is the real self? A child comes into the
      world gin-begotten, with the instinct for liquor in his brain, like the
      scent of the fox in the nostrils of the hound. And that seems the real.
      But the same child caught up on the hands of chance is carried into
      another atmosphere, is cared for by ginhating minds and hearts: habit
      fastens on him&mdash;fair, decent, and temperate habit&mdash;and he grows
      up like the Cure yonder, a brother of Aaron. Which is the real? Is the
      instinct for the gin killed, or covered? Is the habit of good living mere
      habit and mere acting, in which the real man never lives his real life, or
      is it the real life?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who knows! Here am I, born with a question in my mouth, with the
      ever-present 'non possumus' in me. Here am I, to whom life was one poor
      futility; to whom brain was but animal intelligence abnormally developed;
      to whom speechless sensibility and intelligence was the only reality; to
      whom nothing from beyond ever sent a flash of conviction, an intimation,
      into my soul&mdash;not one. To me God always seemed a being of dreams, the
      creation of a personal need and helplessness, the despairing cry of the
      victims of futility&mdash;And here am I flung like a stone from a sling
      into this field where men believe in God as a present and tangible being;
      who reply to all life's agonies and joys and exultations with the words
      'C'est le bon Dieu.' And what shall I become? Will habit do its work, and
      shall I cease to be me? Shall I, in the permanency of habit, become like
      unto this tailor here, whose life narrows into one sole cause; whose only
      wish is to have the Church draw the coverlet of forgiveness and safety
      over him; who has solved all questions in a blind belief or an inherited
      predisposition&mdash;which? This stingy, hard, unhappy man&mdash;how
      should he know what I am denied! Or does he know? Is it all illusion? If
      there is a God who receives such devotion, to the exclusion of natural
      demand and spiritual anxieties, why does not this tailor 'let his light so
      shine before men that they may see his good works, and glorify his Father
      which is in heaven?' That is it. Therefore, wherefore, tailor-man?
      Therefore, wherefore, God? Show me a sign from Heaven, tailor-man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated on his bench in the shop, with his eyes ever and anon raised
      towards the little post-office opposite, he wrote these words. Afterwards
      he sat and thought till the shadows deepened, and the tailor came in to
      supper. Then he took up the pieces of paper, and, going to the fire, which
      was still lighted of an evening, thrust them inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis Trudel saw the paper burning, and, glancing down, he noticed that
      one piece&mdash;the last&mdash;had slipped to the floor and was lying
      under the table. He saw the pencil still in Charley's hand. Forthwith his
      natural suspicion leaped up, and the cunning of the monomaniac was upon
      him. With all his belief in le bon Dieu and the Church, Louis Trudel
      trusted no one. One eye was ever open to distrust man, while the other was
      ever closed with blind belief in Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Charley stooped to put wood in the fire, the tailor thrust a foot
      forward and pushed the piece of paper further under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night the tailor crept down into the shop, felt for the paper in the
      dark, found it, and carried it away to his room. All kinds of thoughts had
      raged through his diseased mind. It was a letter, perhaps, and if a
      letter, then he would gain some facts about the man's life. But if it was
      a letter, why did he burn it? It was said that he never received a letter
      and never sent one, therefore it was little likely to be a letter if not a
      letter, then what could it be? Perhaps the man was English and a spy of
      the English government, for was there not disaffection in some of the
      parishes? Perhaps it was a plan of robbery. To such a state of
      hallucination did his weakened mind come, that he forgot the kindly
      feeling he had had for this stranger who had worked for him without pay.
      Suspicion, the bane of sick old age, was hot on him. He remembered that
      M'sieu' had put an arm through his when they went upstairs, and that now
      increased suspicion. Why should the man have been so friendly? To lull him
      into confidence, perhaps, and then to rob and murder him in his sleep.
      Thank God, his ready money was well hid, and the rest was safe in the bank
      far away! He crept back to his room with the paper in his hand. It was the
      last sheet of what Charley had written, and had been accidentally brushed
      off on the floor. It was in French, and, holding the candle close, he
      slowly deciphered the crabbed, characteristic handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes dilated, his yellow cheeks took on spots of unhealthy red, his
      hand trembled. Anger seized him, and he mumbled the words over and over
      again to himself. Twice or thrice, as the paper lay in one hand, he struck
      it with the clinched fist of the other, muttering and distraught.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This tailor here.... This stingy, hard, unhappy man.... If there is a
      God!... Therefore, wherefore, tailor-man?... Therefore, wherefore, God?...
      Show me a sign from Heaven, tailor-man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hatred of himself, blasphemy, the profane and hellish humour of&mdash;of
      the infidel! A Protestant heretic&mdash;he was already damned; a robber&mdash;you
      could put him in jail; a spy&mdash;you could shoot him or tar and feather
      him; a murderer&mdash;you could hang him. But an infide&mdash;this was a
      deadly poison, a black danger, a being capable of all crimes. An infidel&mdash;"Therefore,
      wherefore, tailor-man?... Therefore, wherefore, God?... Show me a sign
      from Heaven, tailor-man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The devil laughing&mdash;the devil incarnate come to mock a poor tailor,
      to sow plague through a parish where all were at peace in the bosom of the
      Church. The tailor had three ruling passions&mdash;cupidity, vanity, and
      religion. Charley had now touched the three, and the whole man was alive.
      His cupidity had been flattered by the unpaid service of a capable
      assistant, but now he saw that he was paying the devil a wage. His vanity
      was overwhelmed by a satanic ridicule. His religion and his God had been
      assaulted in so shameful a way that no punishment could be great enough
      for the man of hell. In religion he was a fanatic; he was a demented
      fanatic now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust the paper into his pocket, then crept out into the hall and to
      the door of Charley's bedroom. He put his ear to the door. After a moment
      he softly raised the latch, and opened the door and listened again.
      'M'sieu' was in a deep sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis Trudel scarcely knew why he had listened, why he had opened the door
      and stood looking at the figure in the bed, barely definable in the
      semi-darkness of the room. If he had meant harm to the helpless man, he
      had brought no weapon; if he had been curious, there the man was
      peacefully sleeping!
    </p>
    <p>
      His sick, morbid imagination was so alive, that he scarcely knew what he
      did. As he stood there listening, hatred and horror in his heart, a voice
      said to him: "Thou shalt do no murder." The words kept ringing in his
      ears. Yet he had not thought of murder. The fancied command itself was his
      first temptation towards such a deed. He had thought of raising the
      parish, of condign punishment of many sorts, but not this. As he closed
      the door softly, killing entered his mind and stayed there. "Thou shalt
      not" had been the first instigation to "Thou shalt."
    </p>
    <p>
      It haunted him as he returned to his room, undressed himself, and went to
      bed. He could not sleep. "Show me a sign from Heaven, tailor-man!" The
      challenge had been to himself. He must respond to it. The duty lay with
      him; he must answer this black infidel for the Church, for faith, for God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he thought of it, the more Charley's face came before him, with
      the monocle shining and hard in the eye. The monocle haunted him. That was
      the infidel's sign. "Show me a sign from Heaven, tailor-man!" What sign
      should he show?
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he sat up straight in bed. In another minute he was out and
      dressing. Five minutes later he was on his way to the parish church. When
      he reached it he took a tool from his pocket and unscrewed a small iron
      cross from the front door. It was a cross which had been blessed by the
      Pope, and had been brought to Chaudiere by the beloved mother of the Cure,
      now dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I have done with it I will put it back," he said, as he thrust it
      inside his shirt, and hurried stealthily back to his house. As he got into
      bed he gave a noiseless, mirthless laugh. All night he lay with his yellow
      eyes wide open, gazing at the ceiling. He was up at dawn, hovering about
      the fire in the shop.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. THE STEALING OF THE CROSS
    </h2>
    <p>
      If Charley had been less engaged with his own thoughts, he would have
      noticed the curious baleful look in the eyes of the tailor; but he was
      deeply absorbed in a struggle that had nothing to do with Louis Trudel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old fever of thirst and desire was upon him. All morning the door of
      Jolicoeur's saloon was opening and shutting before his mind's eye, and
      there was a smell of liquor everywhere. It was in his nostrils when the
      hot steam rose from the clothes he was pressing, in the thick odour of the
      fulled cloth, in the melting snow outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time and again he felt that he must run out of the shop and away to the
      little tavern where white whiskey was sold to unwise habitants. But he
      fought on. Here was the heritage of his past, the lengthening chain of
      slavery to his old self&mdash;was it his real self? Here was what would
      prevent him from forgetting all that he had been and not been, all the
      happiness he might have had, all that he had lost&mdash;the ceaseless
      reminder. He was still the victim to a poison which gave not only a
      struggle of body, but a struggle of soul&mdash;if he had a soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he had a soul!" The phrase kept repeating itself to him even as he
      fought the fever in his throat, resisting the temptation to take that
      medicine which the Curb's brother had sent him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he had a soul!" The thinking served as an antidote, for by the
      ceaseless iteration his mind was lulled into a kind of drowse. Again and
      again he went to the pail of water that stood on the window-sill, and
      lifting it to his lips, drank deep and full, to quench the wearing thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he had a soul!" He looked at Louis Trudel, silent and morose, the
      clammy yellow of a great sickness in his face and hands, but his mind only
      intent on making a waistcoat&mdash;and the end of all things very near!
      The words he had written the night before came to him: "Therefore,
      wherefore, tailor-man? Therefore, wherefore, God?... Show me a sign from
      Heaven, tailor-man!" As if in reply to his thoughts there came the sound
      of singing, and of bells ringing in the parish church.
    </p>
    <p>
      A procession with banners was coming near. It was a holy day, and
      Chaudiere was mindful of its duties. The wanderers of the parish had come
      home for Easter. All who belonged to Chaudiere and worked in the woods or
      shanties, or lived in big cities far away, were returned&mdash;those who
      could return&mdash;to take the holy communion in the parish church.
      Yesterday the parish had been alive with a pious hilarity. The great
      church had been crowded beyond the doors, the streets had been full of
      cheerily dressed habitants. There had, however, come a sudden chill to the
      seemly rejoicings&mdash;the little iron cross blessed by the Pope had been
      stolen from the door of the church!
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact had been told to the Cure as he said the Mass, and from the altar
      steps, before going to the pulpit, he referred to the robbery with
      poignant feeling; for the relic had belonged to a martyr of the Church,
      who, two centuries before, had laid down his life for the Master on the
      coast of Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis Trudel had heard the Cure's words, and in his place at the rear of
      the church he smiled sourly to himself. In due time the little cross
      should be returned, but it had work to do first. He did not take the holy
      communion this Easter day, or go to confession as was his wont. Not,
      however, until a certain day later did the Cure realise this, though for
      thirty years the tailor had never omitted his Easter-time duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people guessed and guessed, but they knew not on whom to cast
      suspicion at first. No sane Catholic of Chaudiere could possibly have
      taken the holy thing. Presently a murmur crept about that M'sieu' might
      have been the thief. He was not a Catholic, and&mdash;who could tell? Who
      knew where he came from? Who knew what he had been? Perhaps a
      jail-bird-robber-murderer! Charley, however, stitched on, intent upon his
      own struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procession passed the doorway: men bearing banners with sacred texts,
      acolytes swinging censers, a figure of the Saviour carved in wood borne
      aloft, the Cure under a silk canopy, and a long line of habitants
      following with sacred song. People fell upon their knees in the street as
      the procession passed, and the Cure's face was bent here and there, his
      hand raised in blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Louis got up from his bench, and, putting on a coat over his wool
      jacket, hastened to the doorway, knelt down, made the sign of the cross,
      and said a prayer. Then he turned quickly towards Charley, who, looking at
      the procession, then at the tailor, then back again at the procession,
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley was hardly conscious of what he did. His mind had ranged far
      beyond this scene to the large issues which these symbols represented. Was
      it one universal self-deception? Was this "religion" the pathetic, the
      soul-breaking make-believe of mortality? So he smiled&mdash;at himself, at
      his own soul, which seemed alone in this play, the skeleton in armour, the
      thing that did not belong. His own words written that fateful day before
      he died at the Cote Dorion came to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sacristan, acolyte, player, or preacher, Each to his office, but who
      holds the key? Death, only Death, thou, the ultimate teacher, Wilt show it
      to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was suddenly startled from his reverie, through which the procession
      was moving&mdash;a cloud of witnesses. It was the voice of Louis Trudel,
      sharp and piercing:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you believe in God and the Son of God?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows!" answered Charley slowly in reply&mdash;an involuntary
      exclamation of helplessness, an automatic phrase deflected from its first
      significance to meet a casual need of the mind. Yet it seemed like satire,
      like a sardonic, even vulgar, humour. So it struck Louis Trudel, who
      snatched up a hot iron from the fire and rushed forward with a snarl. So
      astounded was Charley that he did not stir. He was not prepared for the
      sudden onslaught. He did not put up his hand even, but stared at the
      tailor, who, within a foot of him, stopped short with the iron poised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis Trudel repented in time. With the cunning of the monomaniac he
      realised that an attack now might frustrate his great stroke. It would
      bring the village to his shop door, precipitate the crisis upon the wrong
      incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it chanced, only one person in Chaudiere saw the act. That was Rosalie
      Evanturel across the way. She saw the iron raised, and looked for M'sieu'
      to knock the tailor down; but, instead, she beheld the tailor go back and
      put the iron on the fire again. She saw also that M'sieu' was speaking,
      though she could hear no words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley's words were simple enough. "I beg your pardon, Monsieur," he said
      across the room to old Louis; "I meant no offence at all. I was trying to
      think it out in a human sort of way. I suppose I wanted a sign from Heaven&mdash;wanted
      too much, no doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tailor's lips twitched, and his hand convulsively clutched the shears
      at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no matter now," he answered shortly. "I have had signs from Heaven;
      perhaps you will have one too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be worth while," rejoined Charley musingly. Charley wondered
      bitterly if he had made an irreparable error in saying those ill-chosen
      words. This might mean a breach between them, and so make his position in
      the parish untenable. He had no wish to go elsewhere&mdash;where could he
      go? It mattered little what he was, tinker or tailor. He had now only to
      work his way back to the mind of the peasant; to be an animal with
      intelligence; to get close to mother earth, and move down the declivity of
      life with what natural wisdom were possible. It was his duty to adapt
      himself to the mind of such as this tailor; to acquire what the tailor and
      his like had found&mdash;an intolerant belief and an inexpensive security,
      to be got through yielding his nature to the great religious dream. And
      what perfect tranquillity, what smooth travelling found therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazing across the street towards the little post-office, he saw Rosalie
      Evanturel at the window. He fell to thinking about her. Rosalie, on her
      part, kept wondering what old Louis' violence meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she saw a half-dozen men come quickly down the street, and,
      before they reached the tailorshop, stand in a group talking excitedly.
      Afterwards one came forward from the others quickly&mdash;Filion Lacasse
      the saddler. He stopped short at the tailor's door. Looking at Charley, he
      exclaimed roughly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't hand out the cross you stole from the church door, we'll tar
      and feather you, M'sieu'." Charley looked up, surprised. It had never
      occurred to him that they could associate him with the theft. "I know
      nothing of the cross," he said quietly. "You're the only heretic in the
      place. You've done it. Who are you? What are you doing here in Chaudiere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Working at my trade," was Charley's quiet answer. He looked towards Louis
      Trudel, as though to see how he took this ugly charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Louis responded at once. "Get away with you, Filion Lacasse," he
      croaked. "Don't come here with your twaddle. M'sieu' hasn't stole the
      cross. What does he want with a cross? He's not a Catholic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he didn't steal the cross, why, he didn't," answered the saddler; "but
      if he did, what'll you say for yourself, Louis? You call yourself a good
      Catholic&mdash;bah!&mdash;when you've got a heretic living with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that to you?" growled the tailor, and reached out a nervous hand
      towards the iron. "I served at the altar before you were born. Sacre! I'll
      make your grave-clothes yet, and be a good Catholic when you're in the
      churchyard. Be off with you. Ach," he sharply added, when Filion did not
      move, "I'll cut your hair for you!" He scrambled off the bench with his
      shears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filion Lacasse disappeared with his friends, and the old man settled back
      on his bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley, looking up quietly from his work, said "Thank you, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not notice what an evil look was in Louis Trudel's face as it
      turned towards him, but Rosalie Evanturel, standing outside, saw it; and
      she stole back to the post-office ill at ease and wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day she watched the tailor's shop, and even when the door was
      shut in the evening, her eyes were fastened on the windows.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. THE SIGN FROM HEAVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The agitation and curiosity possessing Rosalie all day held her in the
      evening when the wooden shutters of the tailor's shop were closed and only
      a flickering light showed through the cracks. She was restless and uneasy
      during supper, and gave more than one unmeaning response to the remarks of
      her crippled father, who, drawn up for supper in his wheel-chair, was more
      than usually inclined to gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damase Evanturel's mind was stirred concerning the loss of the iron cross;
      the threat made by Filion Lacasse and his companions troubled him. The one
      person beside the Cure, Jo Portugais, and Louis Trudel, to whom M'sieu'
      talked much, was the postmaster, who sometimes met him of an evening as he
      was taking the air. More than once he had walked behind the wheel-chair
      and pushed it some distance, making the little crippled man gossip of
      village matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the two sat at supper the postmaster was inclined to take a serious
      view of M'sieu's position. He railed at Filion Lacasse; he called the
      suspicious habitants clodhoppers, who didn't know any better&mdash;which
      was a tribute to his own superior birth; and at last, carried away by a
      feverish curiosity, he suggested that Rosalie should go and look through
      the cracks in the shutters of the tailor-shop and find out what was going
      on within. This was indignantly rejected by Rosalie, but the more she
      thought, the more uneasy she became. She ceased to reply to her father's
      remarks, and he at last relapsed into gloom, and said that he was tired
      and would go to bed. Thereupon she wheeled him inside his bedroom, bade
      him good-night, and left him to his moodiness, which, however, was soon
      absorbed in a deep sleep, for the mind of the little grey postmaster could
      no more hold trouble or thought than a sieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Rosalie began to be tortured. What were they doing in the
      house opposite?
    </p>
    <p>
      Go and look through the windows? But she had never spied on people in her
      life! Yet would it be spying? Would it not be pardonable? In the interest
      of the man who had been attacked in the morning by the tailor, who had
      been threatened by the saddler, and concerning whom she had seen a signal
      pass between old Louis and Filion Lacasse, would it not be a humane thing
      to do? It might be foolish and feminine to be anxious, but did she not
      mean well, and was it not, therefore, honourable?
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery inflamed her imagination. Charley's passiveness when he was
      assaulted by old Louis and afterwards threatened by the saddler seemed to
      her indifference to any sort of danger&mdash;the courage of the hopeless
      life, maybe. Instantly her heart overflowed with sympathy. Monsieur was
      not a Catholic perhaps? Well, so much the more he should be befriended,
      for he was so much the more alone and helpless. If a man was born a
      Protestant&mdash;or English&mdash;he could not help it, and should not be
      punished in this world for it, since he was sure to be punished in the
      next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind became more and more excited. The postoffice had been long since
      closed, and her father was asleep&mdash;she could hear him snoring. It was
      ten o'clock, and there was still a light in the tailor's shop. Usually the
      light went out before nine o'clock. She went to the post-office door and
      looked out. The streets were empty; there was not a light burning
      anywhere, save in the house of the Notary. Down towards the river a sleigh
      was making its way over the thin snow of spring, and screeching on the
      stones. Some late revellers, moving homewards from the Trois Couronnes,
      were roaring at the top of their voices the habitant chanson, 'Le Petit
      Roger Bontemps':
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "For I am Roger Bontemps,
             Gai, gai, gai!
          With drink I am full and with joy content,
             Gai, gaiment!"
</pre>
    <p>
      The chanson died away as she stood there, and still the light was burning
      in the shop opposite. A thought suddenly came to her. She would go over
      and see if the old housekeeper, Margot Patry, had gone to bed. Here was
      the solution to the problem, the satisfaction of modesty and propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the street quickly, hurried round the corner of the house, and
      was passing the side-window of the shop, when a crack in the shutters
      caught her eye. She heard something fall on the floor within. Could it be
      that the tailor and M'sieu' were working at so late an hour? She had an
      irresistible impulse, and glued her eye to the crack.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently she started back with a smothered cry. There by the great
      fireplace stood Louis Trudel picking up a red-hot cross with a pair of
      pincers. Grasping the iron firmly just below the arms of the cross, the
      tailor held it up again. He looked at it with a wild triumph, yet with a
      malignancy little in keeping with the object he held&mdash;the holy relic
      he had stolen from the door of the parish church. The girl gave a low cry
      of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw old Louis advance stealthily towards the door of the shop leading
      into the house. In bewilderment, she stood still an instant, then, with a
      sudden impulse, she ran to the kitchen-door and tried it softly. It was
      not locked. She opened it, entered quickly, and found old Margot standing
      in the middle of the room in her night-dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Rosalie, Rosalie!" cried the old woman, "something's going to happen.
      M'sieu' Trudel has been queer all evening. I peeped in the key-hole of the
      shop just now, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, I've seen too. Come!" said Rosalie, and going quickly to the
      door, opened it, and passed through to another room. Here she opened
      another door, leading into the hall between the shop and the house.
      Entering the hall, she saw a glimmer of light above. It was the reddish
      glow of the iron cross held by old Louis. She crept softly up the stone
      steps. She heard a door open very quietly. She hurried now, and came to
      the landing. She saw the door of Charley's room open&mdash;all the village
      knew what room he slept in&mdash;and the moonlight was streaming in at the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the sleeping man on the bed, and the tailor standing over him.
      Charley was lying with one arm thrown above his head; the other lay over
      the side of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she rushed forward, divining old Louis' purpose, the fiery cross
      descended, and a voice cried: "'Show me a sign from Heaven, tailor-man!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      This voice was drowned by that of another, which, gasping with agony out
      of a deep sleep, as the body sprang upright, cried: "God-oh God!"
      Rosalie's hand grasped old Louis' arm too late. The tailor sprang back
      with a horrible laugh, striking her aside, and rushed out to the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Monsieur, Monsieur!" cried Rosalie, and, snatching a scarf from her
      bosom, thrust it in upon the excoriated breast, as Charley, hardly
      realising what had happened, choked back moans of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did he do?" he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The iron cross from the church door!" she answered. "A minute, one
      minute, Monsieur!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She rushed out upon the landing in time to see the tailor stumble on the
      stairs and fall head forwards to the bottom, at the feet of Margot Patry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie paid no heed to the fallen man. "Oil! flour! Quick!" she cried.
      "Quick! Quick!" She stepped over the body of the tailor, snatched at
      Margot's arm, and dragged her into the kitchen. "Quick-oil and flour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman showed her where they were, moaning and whining.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He tried to kill Monsieur," cried Rosalie, "burned him on the breast with
      the holy cross!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With oil and flour she hurried back, over the body of the tailor, up the
      stairs, and into Charley's room. Charley was now out of bed and half
      dressed, though choking with pain, and preserving consciousness only by a
      great effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Mademoiselle!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the scarf off gently, soaked it in oil and splashed it with
      flour, and laid it quickly back on the burnt flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margot came staggering into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot rouse him. I cannot rouse him. He is dead! He is dead!" she
      whimpered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley swayed forward towards the woman, recovered himself, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now not a word of what he did to me, remember. Not one word, or you will
      go to jail with him. If you keep quiet, I'll say nothing. He didn't know
      what he was doing." He turned to Rosalie. "Not a word of this, please," he
      moaned. "Hide the cross."
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved towards the door. Rosalie saw his purpose, and ran out ahead of
      him and down the stairs to where the tailor lay prone on his face, one
      hand still holding the pincers. The little iron cross lay in a dark
      corner. Stooping, she lifted up the tailor's head, then felt his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is not dead," she cried. "Quick, Margot, some water," she added, to
      the whimpering woman. Margot tottered away, and came again presently with
      the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go for some one to help," Rosalie said, rising to her feet, as she
      saw Charley come slowly down the staircase, his face white with misery.
      She ran and took his arm to help him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, dear Mademoiselle," he said; "I shall be all right presently. You
      must get help to carry him up stairs. Bring the Notary; he and I can carry
      him up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, Monsieur! You&mdash;it would kill you! You are terribly hurt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must help to carry him, else people will be asking questions," he
      answered painfully. "He is going to die. It must not be known&mdash;you
      understand!" His eyes searched the floor until they found the cross.
      Rosalie picked it up with the pincers. "It must not be known what he did
      to me," Charley said to the muttering and weeping old woman. He caught her
      shoulder with his hand, for she seemed scarcely to heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. "Yes, yes, M'sieu', I will never speak." Rosalie was standing
      in the door. "Go quickly, Mademoiselle," he said. She disappeared with the
      iron cross, and flying across the street, thrust it inside the
      post-office, then ran to the house of the Notary.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. THE RETURN OF THE TAILOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Twenty minutes later the tailor was lying in his bed, breathing, but still
      unconscious, the Notary, M'sieu', and the doctor of the next parish, who
      by chance was in Chaudiere, beside him. Charley's face was drawn and
      haggard with pain, for he had helped to carry old Louis to bed, though
      every motion of his arms gave him untold agony. In the doorway stood
      Rosalie and Margot Patry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will he live?" asked the Notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor shook his head. "A few hours, perhaps. He fell downstairs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley nodded. There was silence for some time, as the doctor went on
      with his ministrations, and the Notary sat drumming his fingers on the
      little table beside the bed. The two women stole away to the kitchen,
      where Rosalie again pressed secrecy on Margot. In the interest of the
      cause she had even threatened Margot with a charge of complicity. She had
      heard the phrase "accessory before the fact," and she used it now with
      good effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she took some fresh flour and oil, and thrust them inside the bedroom
      door where Charley now sat clinching his hands and fighting down the pain.
      Careful as ever of his personal appearance, however, he had brushed every
      speck of flour from his clothes, and buttoned his coat up to the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly an hour passed, and then the Cure appeared. When he entered the
      sick man's room, Charley followed, and again Rosalie and old Margot came
      and stood within the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace be to this house!" said the Cure. He had a few minutes of whispered
      conversation with the doctor, and then turned to Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He fell down-stairs, Monsieur? You saw him fall?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was in my room&mdash;I heard him fall, Cure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had he been ill during the day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He appeared to be feeble, and he seemed moody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than usual, Monsieur?" The Cure had heard of the incident of the
      morning when Filion Lacasse accused Charley of stealing the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather more than usual, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure turned towards the door. "You, Mademoiselle Rosalie, how came you
      to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was in the kitchen with Margot, who was not well."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure looked at Margot, who tearfully nodded. "I was ill," she said,
      "and Rosalie was here with me. She helped M'sieu' and me. Rosalie is a
      good girl, and kind to me," she whimpered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure seemed satisfied, and after looking at the sick man for a moment,
      he came close to Charley. "I am deeply pained at what happened to-day," he
      said courteously. "I know you have had nothing to do with the beloved
      little cross."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Notary tried to draw near and listen, but the Cure's look held him
      back. The doctor was busy with his patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are only just, Monsieur," said Charley in response, wishing that
      these kind eyes were fixed anywhere than on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once the Cure laid a hand upon his arm. "You are ill," he said
      anxiously. "You look very ill indeed. See, Vaudrey," he added to the
      doctor, "you have another patient here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The friendly, oleaginous doctor came over and peered into Charley's face.
      "Ill-sure enough!" he said. "Look at this sweat!" he pointed to the drops
      of perspiration on Charley's forehead. "Where do you suffer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Severe pains all through my body," Charley answered simply, for it seemed
      easier to tell the truth, as near as might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must look to you," said the doctor. "Go and lie down, and I will come
      to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley bowed, but did not move. Just then two things drew the attention
      of all: the tailor showed returning consciousness, and there was noise of
      many voices outside the house and the tramping of feet below-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go and tell them no one must come up," said the doctor to the Notary, and
      the Cure made ready to say the last offices for the dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the noise below-stairs diminished, and the priest's voice rose
      in the office, vibrating and touching. The two women sank to their knees,
      the doctor followed, his eyes still fixed on the dying man. Presently,
      however, Charley did the same; for something penetrating and reasonable in
      the devotion touched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once Louis Trudel opened his eyes. Staring round with acute
      excitement, his eyes fell on the Cure, then upon Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop&mdash;stop, M'sieu' le Cure!" he cried. "There's other work to do."
      He gasped and was convulsed, but the pallor of his face was alive with
      fire from the distempered eyes. He snatched from his breast the paper
      Charley had neglected to burn. He thrust it into the Curb's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See&mdash;see!" he croaked. "He is an infidel&mdash;black infidel&mdash;from
      hell!" His voice rose in a kind of shriek, piercing to every corner of the
      house. He pointed at Charley with shaking finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wrote it there&mdash;on that paper. He doesn't&mdash;believe in God."
    </p>
    <p>
      His strength failed him, his hand clutched tremblingly at the air. He
      laughed, a dry, crackling laugh, and his mouth opened twice or thrice to
      speak, but gasping breaths only came forth. With a last effort, however&mdash;as
      the priest, shocked, stretched out his hand and said: "Have done, have
      done, Trudel!"&mdash;he cried, in a voice that quavered shrilly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He asked&mdash;tailor-man&mdash;sign&mdash;from&mdash;Heaven. Look-look!"
      He pointed wildly at Charley. "I&mdash;gave him&mdash;sign of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was the end. With a shudder the body collapsed in a formless
      heap, and the tailor-man was gone to tell of the work he had done for his
      faith on earth.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. THE CURE HAS AN INSPIRATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      White and malicious faces peered through the doorway. There was an ugly
      murmur coming up the staircase. Many habitants had heard Louis Trudel's
      last words, and had passed them on with vehement exaggeration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaudiere had been touched in its most superstitious corner. Protestantism
      was a sin, but atheism was a crime against humanity. The Protestant might
      be the victim of a mistake, but the atheist was the deliberate son of
      darkness, the source of fearful dangers. An atheist in their midst was
      like a scorpion in a flower-bed&mdash;no one could tell when and where he
      would sting. Rough misdemeanours among them had been many, there had once
      been a murder in the parish, but the undefined horrors of infidelity were
      more shameful than crimes the eye could see.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the minds of these excited people the tailor-man's death was due to the
      infidel before them. They were ready to do all that might become a
      Catholic intent to avenge the profaned honour of the Church and the faith.
      Bodily harm was the natural form for their passion to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring him out&mdash;let us have him!" they cried with fierce gestures, to
      which Rosalie Evanturel turned a pained, indignant face.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Curb stood with the paper in his hand, his face set and bitter,
      Rosalie made a step forward. She meant to tell the truth about Louis
      Trudel, and show how good this man was, who stood charged with an
      imaginary crime. But she met the warning eye of the man himself, calm and
      resolute, she saw the suffering in the face, endured with what composure!
      and she felt instantly that she must obey him, and that&mdash;who could
      tell?&mdash;his plan might be the best in the end. She looked at the Cure
      anxiously. What would he say and do? In the Cure's heart and mind a great
      struggle was going on. All his inherent prejudice, the hereditary
      predisposition of centuries, the ingrain hatred of atheism, were alive in
      him, hardening his mind against the man before him. His first impulse was
      to let Charley take his fate at the hands of the people of Chaudiere,
      whatever it might be. But as he looked at the man, as he recalled their
      first meeting, and remembered the simple, quiet life he had lived among
      them&mdash;charitable, and unselfish&mdash;the barriers of creed and habit
      fell down, and tears unbidden rushed into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure had, all at once, the one great inspiration of his life&mdash;its
      one beautiful and supreme imagining. For thus he reasoned swiftly:
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he was, a priest who had shepherded a flock of the faithful passed on
      to him by another priest before him, who again had received them from a
      guardian of the fold&mdash;a family of faithful Catholics whose thoughts
      never strayed into forbidden realms. He had done no more than keep them
      faithful and prevent them from wandering&mdash;counselling, admonishing,
      baptising, and burying, giving in marriage and blessing, sending them on
      their last great journey with the cachet of Holy Church upon them. But
      never once, never in all his life, had he brought a lost soul into the
      fold. If he died to-night, he could not say to St. Peter, when he arrived
      at Heaven's gate: "See, I have saved a soul!" Before the Throne he could
      not say to Him who cried: "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel
      to every creature"&mdash;he could not say: "Lord, by Thy grace I found
      this soul in the wilderness, in the dark and the loneliness, having no God
      to worship, denial and rebellion in his heart; and behold, I took him to
      my breast, and taught him in Thy name, and led him home to Thy haven, the
      Church!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that the Cure dreamed a dream. He would set his life to saving
      this lost soul. He would rescue him from the outer darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face suffused, he handed the paper in his hand back to the man who had
      written the words upon it. Then he lifted his hand against the people at
      the door and the loud murmuring behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace&mdash;peace!" he said, as though from the altar. "Leave this room
      of death, I command you. Go at once to your homes. This man"&mdash;he
      pointed to Charley&mdash;"is my friend. Who seeks to harm him, would harm
      me. Go hence and pray. Pray for yourselves, pray for him, and for me; and
      pray for the troubled soul of Louis Trudel. Go in peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards the house was empty, save for the Cure, Charley, old
      Margot, and the Notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Charley sat in the tailor's bedroom, rigid and calm, though
      racked with pain, and watched the candles flickering beside the dead body.
      He was thinking of the Cure's last words to the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder&mdash;I wonder," he said, and through his eyeglass he stared at
      the crucifix that threw a shadow on the dead man's face. Morning found him
      there. As dawn crept in he rose to his feet. "Whither now?" he said, like
      one in a dream.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. THE WOMAN WHO SAW
    </h2>
    <p>
      Up to the moment of her meeting with Charley, Rosalie Evanturel's life had
      been governed by habit, which was lightly coloured by temperament. Since
      the eventful hour on Vadrome Mountain it had become a life of temperament,
      in which habit was involuntary and mechanical. She did her daily duties
      with a good heart, but also with a sense superior to the practical action.
      This grew from day to day, until, in the tragical days wherein she had
      secretly played a great part, she moved as in a dream, but a dream so
      formal that no one saw any change taking place in her, or associated her
      with the events happening across the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been compelled to answer many questions, for it was known she was
      in the tailor's house when Louis Trudel fell down-stairs, but what more
      was there to tell than that she had run for the Notary, and sent word to
      the Cure, and that she was present when the tailor died, charging M'sieu'
      with being an infidel? At first she was ill disposed to answer any
      questions, but she soon felt that attitude would only do harm. For the
      first time in her life she was face to face with moral problems&mdash;the
      beginning of sorrow, of knowledge, and of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all secrets there is a kind of guilt, however beautiful or joyful they
      may be, or for what good end they may be set to serve. Secrecy means
      evasion, and evasion means a problem to the moral mind. To the primitive
      mind, with its direct yes and no, there is danger of it becoming a
      tragical problem ere it is realised that truth is various and diverse.
      Perhaps even with that Mary who hid the matter in her heart&mdash;the
      exquisite tragedy and glory of Christendom&mdash;there was a delicate
      feeling of guilt, the guilt of the hidden though lofty and beautiful
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If secrecy was guilt, then Charley and Rosalie were bound together by a
      bond as strong as death: Rosalie held the key to a series of fateful days
      and doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ordinary course, they might have known each other for five years and
      not have come to this sensitive and delicate association. With one great
      plunge she had sprung into the river of understanding. In the moment that
      she had thrust her scarf into his scorched breast, in that little upper
      room, the work of years had been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as he lived, that mark must remain on M'sieu's breast&mdash;the
      red, smooth scar of a cross! She had seen the sort of shining scar a bad
      burn makes, and at thought of it she flushed, trembled, and turned her
      head away, as though some one were watching her. Even in the night she
      flushed and buried her face in the pillow when the thought flashed through
      her mind; though when she had soaked the scarf in oil and flour and laid
      it on the angry wound she had not flushed at all, was determined, quiet,
      and resourceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      That incident had made her from a girl into a woman, from a child of the
      convent into a child of the world. She no longer thought and felt as she
      had done before. What she did think or feel could not easily have been set
      down, for her mind was one tremulous confusion of unusual thoughts, her
      heart was beset by new feelings, her imagination, suddenly finding itself,
      was trying its wings helplessly. The past was full of wonder and event,
      the present full of surprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was M'sieu' established already in Louis Trudel's place, having been
      granted a lease of the house and shop by the Curte, on the part of the
      parish, to which the property had been left; receiving also a gift of the
      furniture and of old Margot, who remained where she had been so many
      years. She could easily see Charley at work&mdash;pale and suffering still&mdash;for
      the door was generally open in the sweet April weather, with the birds
      singing, and the trees bursting into blossom. Her wilful imagination
      traced the cross upon his breast&mdash;it almost seemed as if it were
      outside upon his clothes, exposed to every eye, a shining thing all fire,
      not a wound inside, for which old Margot prepared oiled linen now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parish was as perturbed as her own mind, for the mystery of the stolen
      cross had never been cleared up, and a few still believed that M'sieu' had
      taken it. They were of those who kept hinting at dark things which would
      yet be worked upon the infidel in the tailor's shop. These were they to
      whom the Curb's beautiful ambition did not appeal. He had said that if the
      man were an infidel, then they must pray that he be brought into the fold;
      but a few were still suspicious, and they said in Rosalie's presence:
      "Where is the little cross? M'sieu' knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did know. That was the worst of it. The cross was in her possession.
      Was it not necessary, then, to quiet suspicion for his sake? She had
      locked the relic away in a cupboard in her bedroom, and she carried the
      key of it always in her pocket. Every day she went and looked at it, as at
      some ghostly token. To her it was a symbol, not of supernatural things,
      but of life in its new reality to her. It was M'sieu', it was herself, it
      was their secret&mdash;she chafed inwardly that Margot should share a part
      of that secret. If it were only between their two selves&mdash;between
      M'sieu' and herself! If Margot&mdash;she paused suddenly, for she was
      going to say, If Margot would only die! She was not wicked enough to wish
      that; yet in the past few weeks she had found herself capable of thinking
      things beyond the bounds of any past experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found a solution at last. She would go to-night secretly and nail the
      cross again on the church door, and so stop the chatter of evil tongues.
      The moon set very early now, and as every one in Chaudiere was supposed to
      be in bed by ten o'clock, the chances of not being seen were in her
      favour. She received the final impetus to her resolution by a quarrelsome
      and threatening remark of Jo Portugais to some sharp-tongued gossip in the
      post-office. She was glad that Jo should defend M'sieu', but she was
      jealous of his friendship for the tailor. Besides, did there not appear to
      be a secret between Jo and M'sieu'? Was it not possible that Jo knew where
      M'sieu' came from, and all about him? Of late Jo had come in and gone out
      of the shop oftener than in the past, had even brought her bunches of
      mosses for her flower-pots, the first budding lilacs, and some maple-sugar
      made from the trees on Vadrome Mountain. She remembered that when she was
      a girl at school, years ago&mdash;ten years ago&mdash;Jo Portugais, then
      scarcely out of his teens, a cheerful, pleasant, quick-tempered lad, had
      brought her bunches of the mountain-ash berry; that once he had mended the
      broken runner of her sled; and yet another time had sent her a birch-bark
      valentine at the convent, where it was confiscated by the Mother Superior.
      Since those days he had become a dark morose figure, living apart from
      men, never going to confession, seldom going to Mass, unloving and
      unlovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one other person in the parish more unloved. That was the
      woman called Paulette Dubois, who lived in the little house at the outer
      gate of the Manor. Paulette Dubois had a bad name in the parish&mdash;so
      bad that all women shunned her, and few men noticed her. Yet no one could
      say that at the present time she did not live a careful life, justifying,
      so far as eye could see, the protection of the Seigneur, M. Rossignol, a
      man of queer habits and queerer dress, a dabbler in physical science, a
      devout Catholic, and a constant friend of the Cure. He it was who, when an
      effort was made to drive Paulette out of the parish, had said that she
      should not go unless she wished; that, having been born in Chaudiere, she
      had a right to live there and die there; and if she had sinned there, the
      parish was in some sense to blame. Though he had no lodge-gates, and
      though the seigneury was but a great wide low-roofed farmhouse, with an
      observatory, and a chimney-piece dating from the time of Louis the
      Fourteenth, the Seigneur gave Paulette Dubois a little hut at his outer
      gate, which had been there since the great Count Frontenac visited
      Chaudiere. Probably Rosalie spoke to Paulette Dubois more often than did
      any one else in the parish, but that was because the woman came for little
      things at the shop, and asked for letters, and every week sent one&mdash;to
      a man living in Montreal. She sent these letters, but not more than once
      in six months did she get a reply, and she had not had one in a whole
      year. Yet every week she asked, and Rosalie found it hard to answer her
      politely, and sometimes showed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that the two disliked each other without good cause, save that
      they were separated by a chasm as wide as a sea. The one disliked the
      other because she must recognise her; the other chafed because she could
      be recognised by Rosalie officially only.
    </p>
    <p>
      The late afternoon of the day in which Rosalie decided to nail the cross
      on the church door again, Paulette arrived to ask for letters at the
      moment that the office wicket was closed, and Rosalie had answered that it
      was after office hours, and had almost closed the door in her face. As she
      turned away Jo Portugais came out of the tailor-shop opposite. He saw
      Paulette, and stood still an instant. She did the same. A strange look
      passed across the face of each, then they turned and went in opposite
      directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never in her life had time gone so slowly with Rosalie. She watched the
      clock. A dozen times she went to the front door and looked out. She tried
      to read&mdash;it was no use; she tried to spin-her fingers trembled; she
      sorted the letters in the office again, and rearranged every letter and
      parcel and paper in its little pigeonhole&mdash;then did it all over
      again. She took out again the letter Paulette had dropped in the
      letter-box; it was addressed in the name of the man at Montreal. She
      looked at it in a kind of awe, as she had ever done the letters of this
      woman who was without the pale. They had a sense of mystery, an air of
      forbidden imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put the letter back, went to the door again, and looked out. It was
      now time to go. Drawing a hood over her head, she stepped out into the
      night. There was a little frost, though spring was well forward, and the
      smell of the rich earth and the budding trees was sweet to the sense. The
      moon had just set, but the stars were shining, and here and there patches
      of snow on the hillside and in the fields added to the light. Yet it was
      not bright enough to see far, and as Rosalie moved down the street she did
      not notice a figure at a little distance behind, walking on the
      new-springing grass by the roadside. All was quiet at the tavern; there
      was no light in the Notary's house&mdash;as a rule, he sat up late,
      reading; and even the fiddle of Maximilian Cour, the baker, was silent.
      The Cure's windows were dark, and the church with its white tin spire
      stood up sentinel-like above the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie had the fateful cross in her hand as she softly opened the gate of
      the churchyard and approached the great oak doors. Taking a screw-driver
      and some screws from her pocket, she felt with a finger for the old
      screw-holes in the door. Then she began her work, looking fearfully round
      once or twice at first. Presently, however, because the screws were larger
      than the old ones, it became much harder; the task called forth more
      strength, and drove all thought of being seen out of her mind for a space.
      At last, however, she gave the final turn to the handle, and every screw
      was in its place, its top level and smooth with the iron of the cross. She
      stopped and looked round again with an uneasy feeling. She could see no
      one, hear no one, but she began to tremble, and, overcome, she fell on her
      knees before the door, and, with her fingers on the foot of the little
      cross, prayed passionately; for herself, for Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she heard footsteps inside the church. They were coming towards
      the doorway, nearer and nearer. At first she was so struck with terror
      that she could not move. Then with a little cry she sprang to her feet,
      rushed to the gate, threw it open, ran out into the road, ind wildly on
      towards home. She did not stop for at least three hundred yards. Turning
      and looking back she saw at the church door a pale round light. With
      another cry she sped on, and did not pause till she reached the house.
      Then, bursting in and locking the door, she hurried to her room, undressed
      quickly, got into bed without saying her prayers, and buried her face in
      the pillow, shivering and overwrought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footsteps she had heard were those of the Cure and Jo Portugais. The
      Cure had sent for Jo to do some last work upon a little altar, to be used
      the next day for the first time. The carpenter and the carver in wood who
      were responsible for the work had fallen victims to white whiskey on the
      very last day of their task, and had been driven from the church by the
      Cure, who then sent for Jo. Rosalie had not seen the light at the shrine,
      as it was on the side of the church farthest from the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their labour finished, the two came towards the front door, the Cure's
      lantern in his hand. Opening the door, Jo heard the sound of footsteps and
      saw a figure flying down the road. As the Cure came out abstractedly, he
      glanced sorrowfully towards the place where the little cross was used to
      be. He gave a wondering cry, and almost dropped the lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See, see, Portugais," he said, "our little cross again!" Jo nodded. "So
      it seems, Monsieur," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant he saw a hood lying on the ground, and as the Cure held up
      the lantern, peering at the little cross, he hastily picked it up and
      thrust it inside his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange&mdash;very strange!" said the Cure. "It must have been done while
      we were inside. It was not there when we entered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We entered by the vestry door," said Jo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, true-true," responded the Cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It comes as it went," said Jo. "You can't account for some things."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure turned and looked at Jo curiously. "Are you then so
      superstitious, Jo? Nonsense; it is the work of human hands&mdash;very
      human hands," he added sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing to show," said the Cure, seeing Jo's glance round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you see, M'sieu' le Cure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is a mystery which time no doubt will clear up. Meanwhile, let
      us be thankful to God," said the Cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted, the Cure going through a side-gate into his own garden, Jo
      passing out of the churchyard-gate through which Rosalie had gone. He
      looked down the road towards the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" said a voice in his ear. Paulette Dubois stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was you, then," he said, with a glowering look. "What did you want
      with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want with the hood in your coat there?" She threw her head
      back with a spiteful laugh. "Whose do you think it is?" he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and the schoolmaster made verses about her once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was Rosalie Evanturel?" he asked, with aggravating composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have the hood-look at it! You saw her running down the road; I saw
      her come, watched her, and saw her go. She is a thief&mdash;pretty Rosalie&mdash;thief
      and postmistress! No doubt she takes letters too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ones you wait for, and that never come&mdash;eh?" Her face darkened
      with rage and hatred. "I will tell the world she's a thief," she sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who will believe you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will." She was hard and fierce, and looked him in the eyes squarely.
      "You'll give evidence quick enough, if I ask you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't do anything you asked me to-nothing, if it was to save my
      life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll prove her a thief without you. She can't deny it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you try it, I'll&mdash;" He stopped, husky and shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll kill me, eh? You killed him, and you didn't hang. Oh no, you
      wouldn't kill me, Jo," she added quickly, in a changed voice. "You've had
      enough of that kind of thing. If I'd been you, I'd rather have hung&mdash;ah,
      sure!" She suddenly came close to him. "Do you hate me so bad, Jo?" she
      said anxiously. "It's eight years&mdash;do you hate me so bad as then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You keep your tongue off Rosalie Evanturel," he said, and turned on his
      heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught his arm. "We're both bad, Jo. Can't we be friends?" she said
      eagerly, her voice shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't drive a woman too hard," she said between her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Threats! Pah!" he rejoined. "What do you think I'm made of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll find that out," she said, and, turning on her heel, ran down the
      road towards the Manor House. "What had Rosalie to do with the cross?" Jo
      said to himself. "This is her hood." He took it out and looked at it.
      "It's her hood&mdash;but what did she want with the cross?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried on, and as he neared the post-office he saw the figure of a
      woman in the road. At first he thought it might be Rosalie, but as he came
      nearer he saw it was not. The woman was muttering and crying. She wandered
      to and fro bewilderedly. He came up, caught her by the arm, and looked
      into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was old Margot Patry.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. THE WOMAN WHO DID NOT TELL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Oh, M'sieu', I am afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid of what, Margot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the last moment, M'sieu' le Cure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be no last moment to your mind&mdash;you will not know it when
      it comes, Margot."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman trembled. "I am not sorry to die. But I am afraid; it is so
      lonely, M'sieu' le Cure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God is with us, Margot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we are born we do not know. It is on the shoulders of others. When
      we die we know, and we have to answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the answering so hard, Margot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman shook her head feebly and sadly, but did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been a good mother, Margot." She made no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been a good neighbour; you have done unto others as you would be
      done by."
    </p>
    <p>
      She scarcely seemed to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been a good servant&mdash;doing your duty in season and out of
      season; honest and just and faithful."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman's fingers twitched on the coverlet, and she moved her head
      restlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Curb almost smiled, for it seemed as if Margot were finding herself
      wanting. Yet none in Chaudiere but knew that she had lived a blameless
      life&mdash;faithful, friendly, a loving and devoted mother, whose health
      had been broken by sleepless attendance at sick-beds by night, while doing
      her daily work at the house of the late Louis Trudel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will answer for the way you have done your duty, Margot," said the
      Cure. "You have been a good daughter of the Church."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a minute, and in the pause some one rose from a chair by the
      window and looked out on the sunset sky. It was Charley. The woman heard,
      and turned her eyes towards him. "Do you wish him to go?" asked the Cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no&mdash;oh no, M'sieu'!" she said eagerly. She had asked all day
      that either Rosalie or M'sieu' should be in the room with her. It would
      seem as though she were afraid she had not courage enough to keep the
      secret of the cross without their presence. Charley had yielded to her
      request, while he shrank from granting it. Yet, as he said to himself, the
      woman was keeping his secret&mdash;his and Rosalie's&mdash;and she had
      some right to make demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Cure asked the question of old Margot, he turned expectantly, and
      with a sense of relief. He thought it strange that the Cure should wish
      him to remain. The Cure, on his part, was well pleased to have him in the
      influence of a Christian death-bed. A time must come when the last
      confidences of the dying woman could be given to no ears but his own, but
      meanwhile it was good that M'sieu' should be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M'sieu' le Cure," said the dying woman, "must I tell all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All what, Margot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that is sin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no must, Margot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you should ask me, M'sieu'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and the man at the window turned and looked curiously at her.
      He saw the problem in the woman's mind: had she the right to die with the
      secret of another's crime upon her mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      "The priest does not ask, Margot: it is you who confess your sins. That is
      between you and God."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure spoke firmly, for he wanted the man at the window to clearly
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if there are the sins of others, and you know, and they trouble your
      soul, M'sieu'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have nothing to do with the sins of others; it is enough to repent of
      your own sins. The priest has nothing to do with any sins but those
      confessed by the sinner to himself. Your own sins are your sole concern
      to-night, Margot."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman's face seemed to clear a little, and her eyes wandered to the
      man at the window with less anxiety. Charley was wondering whether, after
      all, she would have the courage to keep her word, whether spiritual terror
      would surmount the moral attitude of honour. He was also wondering how
      much right he had to put the strain upon the woman in her desperate hour.
      "How long did the doctor say I could live?" the woman asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Till morning, perhaps, Margot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to live till sunrise," she answered, "till after breakfast.
      Rosalie makes good tea," she added musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure almost smiled. "There is the Living Bread, my daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. "But I should like to see the sunrise and have Rosalie bring
      me tea," she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, Margot. We will ask God for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind flew back again to the old question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it wrong to keep a secret?" she asked, her face turned away from the
      man at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it is the secret of a sin, and the sin is your own&mdash;yes, Margot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if the sin is not your own?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you share the sin, and if the secret means injury to others, and a
      wrong is being done, and the law can right that wrong, then you must go to
      the law, not to your priest."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure's look was grave, even anxious, for he saw that the old woman's
      mind was greatly disturbed. But her face cleared now, and stayed so. "It
      has all been a mix and a muddle," she answered; "and it hurt my poor head,
      M'sieu' le Cure, but now I think I under stand. I am not afraid; I will
      confess."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure had made it clear to her that she could carry to her grave the
      secret of the little cross and the work it had done, and so keep her word
      and still not injure her chances of salvation. She was content. She no
      longer needed the helpful presence of M'sieu' or Rosalie. Charley
      instinctively felt what was in her mind, and came towards the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell Mademoiselle Rosalie about the tea," he said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him, almost smiling. "Thank you, good M'sieu'," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will confess now, M'sieu' le Cure" she continued. Charley left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards morning Margot waked out of a brief sleep, and found the Cure and
      his sister and others about her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it near sunrise?" she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is just sunrise. See; God has been good," answered the Cure, drawing
      open the blind and letting in the first golden rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie entered the room with a cup of tea, and came towards the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Margot looked at the girl, at the tea, and then at the Cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink the tea for me, Rosalie," she whispered. Rosalie did as she was
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round feebly; her eyes were growing filmy. "I never gave&mdash;so
      much&mdash;trouble&mdash;before," she managed to say. "I never had&mdash;so
      much&mdash;attention.... I can keep&mdash;a secret too," she said, setting
      her lips feebly with pride. "But I&mdash;never&mdash;had&mdash;so much&mdash;attention&mdash;before;
      have I&mdash;Rosalie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie did not need to answer, for the woman was gone. The crowning
      interest of her life had come all at the last moment, as it were, and she
      had gone away almost gladly and with a kind of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie also had a hidden pride: the secret was now her very own&mdash;hers
      and M'sieu's.

      CHAPTER XXIV. THE SEIGNEUR TAKES A HAND IN THE GAME
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was St. Jean Baptiste's day, and French Canada was en fete. Every
      seigneur, every cure, every doctor, every notary&mdash;the chief figures
      in a parish&mdash;and every habitant was bent for a happy holiday, dressed
      in his best clothes, moved in his best spirits, in the sweet summer
      weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bells were ringing, flags were flying, every road and lane was filled with
      caleches and wagons, and every dog that could draw a cart pulled big and
      little people, the old and the blind and the mendicant, the happy and the
      sour, to the village, where there were to be sports and speeches, races
      upon the river, and a review of the militia, arranged by the member of the
      Legislature for the Chaudiere-half of the county. French soldiers in
      English red coats and carrying British flags were straggling along the
      roads to join the battalion at the volunteers' camp three miles from the
      town, and singing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Brigadier, respondez Pandore&mdash;
          Brigadier, vous avez raison."
</pre>
    <p>
      It was not less incongruous and curious when one group presently broke out
      into 'God save the Queen', and another into the 'Marseillaise', and
      another still into 'Malbrouck s'en va t'en guerre'. At last songs and
      soldiers were absorbed in the battalion at the rendezvous, and the long
      dusty march to the village gave a disciplined note to the gaiety of the
      militant habitant.
    </p>
    <p>
      At high noon Chaudiere was filled to overflowing. There were booths and
      tents everywhere&mdash;all sorts of cheap-jacks vaunted their wares,
      merry-go-rounds and swings and shooting-galleries filled the usual spaces
      in the perspective. The Cure, M. Rossignol the Seigneur, and the Notary
      stood on the church steps viewing the scene and awaiting the approach of
      the soldier-citizens. The Seigneur and the Cure had ceased listening to
      the babble of M. Dauphin, who seemed not to know that his audience closed
      its ears and found refuge in a "Well, well!" or "Think of that!" or an
      abstracted "You surprise me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Notary talked on with eager gesture and wreathing smile, shaking back
      his oiled ringlets as though they trespassed on his smooth, somewhat
      jaundiced cheeks, until it began to dawn upon him that there was no coin
      of real applause to be got at this mint. Fortune favoured him at the
      critical juncture, for the tailor walked slowly past them, looking neither
      to right nor to left, his eyes cast upon the ground, apparently oblivious
      to all round him. Almost opposite the church door, however, Charley was
      suddenly stopped by Filion Lacasse, who ran out from a group before the
      tavern, and, standing in front of him with outstretched hand, said loudly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "M'sieu', it's all right. What you said done it, sure! I'm a thousand
      dollars richer to-day. You may be an infidel, but you have a head, and you
      save me money, and you give away your own, and that's good enough for me,"&mdash;he
      wrung Charley's hand,&mdash;"and I don't care who knows it&mdash;sacre!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley did not answer him, but calmly withdrew his hand, smiled, raised
      his hat at the lonely cheer the saddler raised, and passed on, scarce
      conscious of what had happened. Indeed he was indifferent to it, for he
      had a matter on his mind this day which bitterly absorbed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Notary was not indifferent. "Look there, what do you think of
      that?" he asked querulously. "I am glad to see that Lacasse treats
      Monsieur well," said the Cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of that, Monsieur?" repeated the Notary excitedly to
      the Seigneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur put his large gold-handled glass to his eye and looked
      interestedly after Charley for a moment, then answered: "Well, Dauphin,
      what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's been giving Filion Lacasse advice about the old legacy business, and
      Filion's taken it; and he's got a thousand dollars; and now there's all
      that fuss. And four months ago Filion wanted to tar and feather him for
      being just what he is to-day&mdash;an infidel&mdash;an infidel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going to say something else, but he did not like the look the Cure
      turned on him, and he broke off short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you regret that he gave Lacasse good advice?" asked the Cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's taking bread out of other men's mouths."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It put bread into Filion's mouth. Did you ever give Lacasse advice? The
      truth now, Dauphin!" said the Seigneur drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Monsieur, and sound advice too, within the law-precedent and code
      and every legal fact behind." The Seigneur was a man of laconic speech.
      "Tut, tut, Dauphin; precedent and code and legal fact are only good when
      there's brain behind 'em. The tailor yonder has brains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but what does he know about the law?" answered Dauphin, with
      acrimonious voice but insinuating manner, for he loved to stand well with
      the Seigneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough for the saddler evidently," sharply rejoined the Seigneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dauphin was fighting for his life, as it were. His back was to the wall.
      If this man was to be allowed to advise the habitants of Chaudiere on
      their disputes and "going to law," where would his own prestige be? His
      vanity had been deeply wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's guesswork with him. Let him stick to his trade as I stick to mine.
      That sort of thing only does harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He puts a thousand dollars into the saddler's pocket: that's a positive
      good. He may or may not take thereby ten dollars out of your pocket:
      that's a negative injury. In this case there was no injury, for you had
      already cost Lacasse&mdash;how much had you cost him, Dauphin?" continued
      the Seigneur, with a half-malicious smile. "I've been out of Chaudiere for
      near a year; I don't know the record&mdash;how much, eh, Dauphin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Notary was too offended to answer. He shook his ringlets back angrily,
      and a scarlet spot showed on each straw-coloured cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty dollars is what Lacasse paid our dear Dauphin," said the Cure
      benignly, "and a very proper charge. Lacasse probably gave Monsieur there
      quite as much, and Monsieur will give it to the first poor man he meets,
      or send it to the first sick person of whom he hears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own opinion is, he's playing some game here," said the Notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all play games," said the Seigneur. "His seems to give him hard work
      and little luxury. Will you bring him to see me at the Manor, my dear
      Cure?" he added. "He will not go. I have asked him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall visit him at his tailor-shop," said the Seigneur. "I need a
      new suit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you always had your clothes made in Quebec, Monsieur," said the
      Notary, still carping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We never had such a tailor," answered the Seigneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll hear more of him before we're done with him," obstinately urged the
      Notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would give Dauphin the greatest pleasure if our tailor proved to be a
      murderer or a robber. I suppose you believe that he stole our little cross
      here," the Cure added, turning to the church door, where his eye lingered
      lovingly on the relic, hanging on a pillar just inside, whither he had had
      it removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not sure yet he hadn't something to do with it," was the stubborn
      response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he did, may it bring him peace at last!" said the Cure piously. "I
      have set my heart on nailing him to our blessed faith as that cross is
      fixed to the pillar yonder&mdash;'I will fasten him like a nail in a sure
      place,' says the Book. I take it hard that my friend Dauphin will not help
      me on the way. Suppose the man were evil, then the Church should try to
      snatch him like a brand from the burning. But suppose that in his past
      there was no wrong necessary to be hidden in the present&mdash;and this I
      believe with all my heart; suppose that he was wronged, not wronging: then
      how much more should the Church strive to win him to the light! Why, man,
      have you no pride in Holy Church? I am ashamed of you, Dauphin, with your
      great intelligence, your wide reading. With our knowledge of the world we
      should be broader."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur's eyes were turned away, for there was in them at once humour
      and a suspicious moisture. Of all men in the world he most admired the
      Cure, for his utter truth and nobility; but he could not help smiling at
      his enthusiasm&mdash;his dear Cure turned evangelist like any "Methody"!&mdash;and
      at the appeal of the Notary on the ground of knowledge of the world. He
      was wise enough to count himself an old fogy, a provincial, and "a
      simon-pure habitant," but of the three he only had any knowledge of life.
      As men of the world the Cure and the Notary were sad failures, though they
      stood for much in Chaudiere. Yet this detracted nothing from the fine
      gentlemanliness of the Cure or the melodramatic courtesy of the Notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amused and touched as the Seigneur had been at the Cure's words, he turned
      now and said: "Always on the weaker side, Cure; always hoping the best
      from the worst of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am only following an example at my door&mdash;you taught us all charity
      and justice," answered M. Loisel, looking meaningly at the Seigneur. There
      was silence a little while, for all three were thinking of the woman of
      the hut, at the gate of the Seigneur's manor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this topic M. Dauphin was not voluble. His original kindness to the
      woman had given him many troubled hours at home, for Madame Dauphin had
      construed his human sympathy into the dark and carnal desires of the
      heart, and his truthful eloquence had made his case the worse. A miserable
      sentimentalist, the Notary was likely to be misunderstood for ever, and
      one or two indiscretions of his extreme youth had been a weapon against
      him through the long years of a blameless married life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heaved a sigh of sympathy with the Cure now. "She has not come back
      yet?" he said to the Seigneur. "No sign of her. She locked up and stepped
      out, so my housekeeper says, about the time&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The day of old Margot's funeral," interposed the Notary. "She'd had a
      letter that day, a letter she'd been waiting for, and abroad she went&mdash;alas!
      the flyaway&mdash;from bad to worse, I fear&mdash;ah me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur turned sharply on him. "Who told you she had a letter that
      day, for which she had been waiting?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Evanturel."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur's face became sterner still. "What business had he to know
      that she received a letter that day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is postmaster," innocently replied the Notary. "He is the devil!" said
      the Seigneur tartly. "I beg your pardon, Cure; but it is Evanturel's
      business not to know what letters go to and fro in that office. He should
      be blind and dumb, so far as we all are concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember that Evanturel is a cripple," the Cure answered gently. "I am
      glad, very glad it was not Rosalie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie has more than usual sense for her sex," gruffly but kindly
      answered the Seigneur, a look of friendliness in his eyes. "I shall talk
      to her about her father; I can't trust myself to speak to the man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie is down there with Madame Dauphin," said the Notary, pointing.
      "Shall I ask her to come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur nodded. He was magistrate and magnate, and he was the
      guarantor of the post-office, and of Rosalie and her father. His eyes
      fixed in reverie on Rosalie; he and the Cure passively waited her
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came over, pale and a little anxious, but with a courageous look. She
      had a vague sense of trouble, and she feared it might be the little cross,
      that haunting thing of all these months.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came near, the Cure greeted her courteously, and then, taking the
      Notary by the arm, led him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur and Rosalie being left alone, the girl said: "You wish to
      speak with me, Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur scrutinised her sharply. Though her colour came and went, her
      look was frank and fearless. She had had many dark hours since that
      fateful month of April. At night, trying to sleep, she had heard the
      ghostly footsteps in the church, which had sent her flying homeward. Then,
      there was the hood. She had waited on and on, fearing word would come that
      it had been found in the churchyard, and that she had been seen putting
      the cross back upon the church door. As day after day passed she had come
      at length to realise that, whatever had happened to the hood, she was not
      suspected. Yet the whole train of circumstances had a supernatural air,
      for the Cure and Jo Portugais had not made public their experience on the
      eventful night; she had been educated in a land of legend and
      superstition, and a deep impression had been made upon her mind, giving to
      her other new emotions a touch of pathos, of imagination, and adding
      character to her face. The old Seigneur stroked his chin as he looked at
      her. He realised that a change had come upon her, that she had developed
      in some surprising way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened&mdash;who has happened, Mademoiselle Rosalie?" he
      asked. He had suddenly made up his mind about that look in her face&mdash;he
      thought it the woman in her which answers to the call of man, not perhaps
      any particular man, but man the attractive influence, the complement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes dropped, then raised frankly to his. "I don't know,"&mdash;adding,
      with a quick humour, for he had been very friendly with her, and joked
      with her in his dry way all her life; "do you, Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled his nose with a quick gesture habitual to him, and answered
      slowly and meaningly: "The government's a good husband and pays regular
      wages, Mademoiselle. I'd stick to government."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not asking for a divorce, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled his nose again delightedly&mdash;so many people were
      pathetically in earnest in Chaudiere&mdash;even the Cure's humour was too
      mediaeval and obvious. He had never before thought Rosalie so separate
      from them all. All at once he had a new interest in her. His cheek flushed
      a little, his eye kindled, humour relaxed his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No other husband would intrude so little," he rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, there's little love lost between us, Monsieur." She felt
      exhilaration in talking with him, a kind of joy in measuring word against
      word; yet a year ago she would have done no more than smile respectfully
      and give a demure reply if the Seigneur had spoken to her like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur noted the mixed emotions in her face and the delicate
      alertness of expression. As a man of the world, he was inclined to believe
      that only one kind of experience can bring such looks to a woman's face.
      He saw in her the awakening of the deeper interests of life, the tremulous
      apprehension of nascent emotions and passions which, at some time or
      other, give beauty and importance to the nature of every human being. It
      did not occur to him that the tailor&mdash;the mysterious figure in the
      parish&mdash;might be responsible. He was observant, but not imaginative;
      he was moved by what he saw, in a quiet, unexplainable manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The government is the best sort of husband. From the other sort you would
      get more kisses and less ha'pence," he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That might be a satisfactory balance-sheet, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, Mademoiselle Rosalie," he rejoined, half seriously, "that you
      don't miss the ha'pence before you get the kisses."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned pale in very fear. What was he going to say? Was the
      post-office to be taken from them? She came straight to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have I done wrong, Monsieur? I've never kept the mail-stage waiting;
      I've never left the mailbag unlocked; I've never been late in opening the
      wicket; I've never been careless, and no one's ever complained of a lost
      letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur saw her agitation, and was sorry for her. He came to the
      point as she had done:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will have you made postmistress&mdash;you alone, Rosalie Evanturel.
      I've made up my mind to that. But you'll promise not to get married&mdash;eh?
      Anyhow, there's no one in the parish for you to marry. You're too
      well-born and you've been too well educated for a habitant's wife&mdash;and
      the Cure or I can't marry you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not taken back to see her flush deeply, and it pleased him to see
      this much life rising to his own touch, this much revelation to give his
      mind a new interest. He had come to that age when the mind is surprised to
      find that the things that once charmed charm less, and the things once
      hated are less acutely repulsive. He saw her embarrassment. He did not
      know that this was the first time that she had ever thought of marriage
      since it ceased to be a dream of girlhood, and, by reason of thinking much
      on a man, had become a possibility, which, however, she had never
      confessed to herself. Here she was faced by it now in the broad open day:
      a plain, hard statement, unrelieved by aught save the humour of the shrewd
      eyes bent upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer him at once. "Do you promise not to marry so useless a
      thing as man, and to remain true to the government?" he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I wished to marry a man, I should not let the government stand in my
      way," she said, in brave confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But do you wish to marry any man?" he asked abruptly, even petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not asked myself that question, Monsieur, and&mdash;should you ask
      it, unless&mdash;" she said, and paused with as pretty and whimsical a
      glance of merriment as could well be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He burst out laughing at the swift turn she had given her reply, and at
      the double suggestion. Then he suddenly changed. A curious expression
      filled his eyes. A smile, almost beautiful, came to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Pon my honour," he said, in a low tone, "you have me caught! And I beg
      to say&mdash;I beg to say," he added, with a flush mounting in his own
      face, a sudden inspiration in his look, "that if you do not think me too
      old and crabbed and ugly, and can endure me, I shall be profoundly happy
      if you will marry me, Rosalie."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood upright, holding himself very hard, for this idea had shot into
      his mind all in an instant, though, unknown to himself, it had been
      growing for years, cherished by many a kind act to her father and by a
      simple gratitude on her part. He had spoken without feeling the absurdity
      of the proposal. He had never married, and he was unprepared to make any
      statement on such a theme; but now, having made it somehow, he would stand
      by it, in spite of any and all criticism. He had known Rosalie since her
      birth, her education was as good as a convent could secure, she was the
      granddaughter of a notable seigneur, and here she was, as fine a type of
      health, beauty and character as man could wish&mdash;and he was only
      fifty! Life was getting lonelier for him every day, and, after all, why
      should he leave distant relations and the Church his worldly goods? All
      this flashed through his mind as he waited for her answer. Now it seemed
      to him that he had meant to say this thing for many years. He had seen an
      awakening in her&mdash;he had suddenly been awakened himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, Monsieur," she said in a bewildered way, "do not amuse yourself
      at my expense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would it be that, then?" he said, with a smile, behind which there was
      determination and self-will. "I want you to marry me; I do with all my
      heart. You shall have those ha'pence, and the kisses too, if so be you
      will take them&mdash;or not, as you will, Rosalie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," she gasped, for something caught her in the throat, and the
      tears started to her eyes, "ask me to forget that you have ever said those
      words. Oh, Monsieur, it is not possible, it never could be possible! I am
      only the postmaster's daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are my wife, if you will but say the word," he answered, "and I as
      proud a husband as the land holds!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were always kind to me, Monsieur," she rejoined, her lips trembling;
      "won't you be so still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am too old?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no, it is not that," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have as good manners as my mother had. You need not fear comparison
      with any lady in the land. Have I not known you all your life? I know the
      way you have come, and your birth is as good as mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, it is not that, Monsieur!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you my word that I do not come to you because no one else would
      have me," he said with a curious simplicity. "I never asked a woman to
      marry me&mdash;never! You are the first. There was talk once&mdash;but it
      was all false. I never meant to ask any one to marry me. But I have the
      wish now which I never had in my youth. I thought best of myself always;
      now, I think&mdash;I think better of you than&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Monsieur, I beg of you, no more! I cannot; oh, I cannot&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You&mdash;but no; I will not ask you, Mademoiselle. If you have some one
      else in your heart, or want some one else there, that is your affair, not
      mine&mdash;undoubtedly. I would have tried to make you happy; you would
      have had peace and comfort all your life; you could have trusted me&mdash;but
      there it is...." He felt all at once that he was unfair to her, that he
      had thrust upon her too hard a problem in too troubled an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could trust you with my life, Monsieur Rossignol," she replied. "And I
      love you in a way that a man may be loved to no one's harm or sorrow: it
      is true that!" She raised her eyes to his simply, trustingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her steadily for a moment. "If you change your mind&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, then," he went on, for he thought it wise not to press her now,
      though he had no intention of taking her no as final. "I'll keep an eye on
      you. You'll need me some day soon; I can do things that the Cure can't,
      perhaps." His manner changed still more. "Now to business," he continued.
      "Your father has been talking about letters received and sent from the
      post-office. That is punishable. I am responsible for you both, and if it
      is reported, if the woman were to report it&mdash;you know the letter I
      mean&mdash;there would be trouble. You do not talk. Now I am going to ask
      the government to make you sole postmistress, with full responsibility.
      Then you must govern your father&mdash;he hasn't as much sense as you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, we owe you so much! I am deeply grateful, and, whatever you do
      for us, you may rely on me to do my duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      They could scarcely hear each other speak now, for the soldiers were
      coming nearer, and the fife-and-drum bands were screeching, 'Louis the
      King was a Soldier'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will keep the government as your husband?" he asked, with forced
      humour, as he saw the Cure and the Notary approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is less trouble, Seigneur," she answered, with a smile of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Rossignol turned to the Cure and the Notary. "I have just offered
      Mademoiselle a husband she might rule in place of a government that rules
      her, and she has refused," he said in the Cure's ear, with a dry laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a sensible girl, is Rosalie," said the Cure, not apprehending.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers were now opposite the church, and riding at their head was
      the battalion Colonel, also member of the Legislature.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all moved down, and Rosalie disappeared in the crowd. As the Seigneur
      and the Cure greeted the Colonel, the latter said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "At luncheon I'll tell you one of the bravest things ever seen. Happened
      half-hour ago at the Red Ravine. Man who did it wore an eye-glass&mdash;said
      he was a tailor."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. THE COLONEL TELLS HIS STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Colonel had lunched very well indeed. He had done justice to every
      dish set before him; he had made a little speech, congratulating himself
      on having such a well-trained body of men to command, and felicitating
      Chaudiere from many points of view. He was in great good-humour with
      himself, and when the Notary asked him&mdash;it was at the Manor, with the
      soldiers resting on the grass without&mdash;about the tale of bravery he
      had promised them, he brought his fist down on the table with great
      intensity but little noise, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chaudiere may well be proud of it. I shall refer to it in the Legislature
      on the question of roads and bridges&mdash;there ought to be a stone fence
      on that dangerous road by the Red Ravine&mdash;Have I your attention?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up, for he was an excitable and voluble Colonel, and he loved
      oration as a cat does milk. With a knife he drew a picture of the locale
      on the table cloth. "Here I was riding on my sorrel, all my noble fellows
      behind, the fife and drums going as at Louisburg&mdash;that day! Martial
      ardour united to manliness and local pride&mdash;follow me? Here we were,
      Red Ravine left, stump fences and waving fields of grain right. From
      military point of view, bad position&mdash;ravine, stump fence, brave
      soldiers in the middle, food for powder&mdash;catch it?&mdash;see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He emptied his glass, drew a long breath, and again began, the
      carving-knife cutting a rhetorical path before him. "I was engaged upon
      the military problem&mdash;demonstration in force, no scouts ahead, no
      rearguard, ravine on the right, stump fence on the left, red coats,
      fife-and-drum band, concealed enemy&mdash;follow me? Observant mind always
      sees problems everywhere&mdash;unresting military genius accustoms
      intelligence to all possible contingencies&mdash;'stand what I mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur took a pinch of snuff, and the Cure, whose mind was
      benevolent, listened with the gravest interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the juncture when, in my mind's eye, I saw my gallant fellows
      enfiladed with a terrible fire, caught in a trap, and I, despairing,
      spurring on to die at their head&mdash;have I your attention?&mdash;just
      at that moment there appeared between the ravine and the road ahead a man.
      He wore an eye-glass; he seemed an unconcerned spectator of our movements&mdash;so
      does the untrained, unthinking eye look out upon destiny! Not far away was
      a wagon, in it a man. Wagon bisecting our course from a cross-road&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a line on the table-cloth with the carvingknife, and the Notary
      said: "Yes, yes, the concession road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, Messieurs. There were we, a battalion and a fife-and-drum band; there
      was the man with the eyeglass, the indifferent spectator, yet the engine
      of fate; there was the wagon, a mottled horse, and a man driving&mdash;catch
      it? The mottled horse took fright at our band, which at that instant
      strikes up 'The Chevalier Drew his Sabre'. He shies from the road with a
      leap, the man falls backwards into the wagon, and the reins drop. The
      horse dashes from the road into the open, and rushes on to the ravine.
      What good now to stop the fifes and drums-follow me? What can we, an armed
      force, bandoleered, knapsacked, sworded, rifled, impetuous, brave, what
      can we do before this tragedy? The man in the wagon senseless, the flying
      horse, the ravine, death! How futile the power of man&mdash;'stand what I
      mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't your battalion shoot the horse?" said the Seigneur drily,
      taking a pinch of snuff. "Monsieur," said the Colonel, "see the irony, the
      implacable irony of fate&mdash;we had only blank cartridge! But see you,
      here was this one despised man with an eye-glass, a tailor&mdash;takes
      nine tailors to make a man!&mdash;between the ravine and the galloping
      tragedy. His spirit arrayed itself like an army with banners, prepared to
      wrestle with death as Jacob wrestled with his shadow all the night 'sieur
      le Cure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure bowed; the Notary shook back his oiled locks in excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awoke a whole man&mdash;nine-ninths, as in Adam&mdash;in the obscure soul
      of the tailor, and, rushing forward, he seized the mottled horse by the
      bridle as he galloped upon the chasm: The horse dragged him on&mdash;dragged
      him on&mdash;on&mdash;on. We, an army, so to speak, stood and watched the
      Tailor and the Tragedy! All seemed lost, but, by the decree of fate&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The will of God," said the Cure softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the great decree, the man was able to stop the horse, not a half-dozen
      feet from the ravine. The horse and the insensible driver were spared
      death&mdash;death. So, Messieurs, does bravery come from unexpected places&mdash;see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur, the Cure, and even the Notary clapped their hands, and
      murmured praises of the tailor-man. But the Colonel did not yet take his
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But now, mark the sequel," he said. "As I galloped over, I saw the tailor
      look into the wagon, and turn away quickly. He waited by the horse till I
      came near, and then walked off without a word. I rode up, and tapped him
      with my sword upon the shoulder. 'A noble deed, my good man,' said I. 'I
      approve of your conduct, and I will remember it in the Legislature when I
      address the committee of the whole house on roads and bridges.' What do
      you think was his reply to my affable words? When I tapped him approvingly
      on the shoulder a second time, he screwed his eye-glass in his eye, and,
      with no emotion, though my own eyes were full of tears, he said, in a tone
      of affront, 'Look after the man there, constable,' and pointed to the
      wagon. Constable&mdash;mon Dieu! Gross manners even for a tailor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had not thought his manners bad," said the Cure, as the Colonel sat
      down, gulped a glass of brandy-and-water, and mopped his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A most remarkable tailor," said the Seigneur, peering into his snuff-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the driver of the mottled horse?" asked the Notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knocked senseless. One of my captains soon restored him. He followed us
      into the village. He is a quack-doctor. I suppose he is now selling
      tinctures, pulling teeth, and driving away rheumatics. He gave me his
      card. I told him he should leave one on the tailor."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a flourish he threw a professional card upon the table, before the
      Cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure picked it up and read:

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. A SONG, A BOTTLE, AND A GHOST
    </h2>
    <p>
      All day John Brown, ex-clergyman and quack-doctor, harangued the people of
      Chaudiere from his gaily-painted wagon. He had the perfect gift of the
      charlatan, and he had discovered his metier. Inclined to the picturesque
      by nature, melodramatic and empirical, his earlier career had been the due
      fruit of habit and education. As a dabbler in mines he had been out of his
      element. He lacked the necessary reticence, and arsenic had not availed
      him, though it had tempted Billy Wantage to forgery; and because Billy hid
      himself behind the dismal opportunity of silence, had ruined the name of a
      dead man called Charley Steele. Since Charley's death John Brown had never
      seen Billy: he had left the town one woful day an hour after Billy had
      told him of the discovery Charley had made. From a far corner of the
      country he had read the story of Charley's death; of the futile trial of
      the river-drivers afterwards, ending in acquittal, and the subsequent
      discovery of the theft of the widows' and orphans' trust-moneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this St. Jean Baptiste's day he was thinking of anything and everything
      else but Charley Steele. Nothing could have been a better advertisement
      for him than the perilous incident at the Red Ravine. Falling backwards
      when the horse suddenly bolted, his head had struck the medicine-chest,
      and he had lain insensible till brought back to consciousness by the good
      offices of the voluble Colonel. He had not, therefore, seen Charley. It
      was like him that his sense of gratitude to the unknown tailor should be
      presently lost in exploiting the interest he created in the parish. His
      piebald horse, his white "plug" hat, his gaily painted wagon, his
      flamboyant manner, and, above all, the marvellous tale of his escape from
      death, were more exciting to the people of Chaudiere than the militia, the
      dancing-bears, the shooting-galleries, or the boat-races. He could sing
      extremely well&mdash;had he not trained his own choir when he was a
      parson? had not Billy approved his comic songs?&mdash;and these comic
      songs, now sandwiched between his cures and his sales, created much
      laughter. He cured headaches, toothaches, rheumatism, and all sorts of
      local ailments "with despatch." He miraculously juggled away pains by what
      he called his Pain Paint, and he stopped a cough by a laugh and a dose of
      his Golden Pectoral. In the exuberance of trade, which steadily increased
      till sundown, he gave no thought to the tailor, to whom, however, he had
      sent by a messenger a two-dollar bill and two bottles of Pain Paint, with
      the lordly announcement that he would call in the evening and "present his
      compliments and his thanks." The messenger left the Pain Paint on the
      door-step of the tailor-shop, and the two dollars he promptly spent at the
      Trois Couronnes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie Evanturel rescued the bottles from the doorstep and awaited
      Charley's return to his shop, that she might take them over to him, and so
      have an excuse to speak with him; for to-day her heart and mind were full
      of him. He had done a brave thing for the medicine-man, and had then fled
      from public gaze as a brave man should. There was no one to compare with
      him. Not even the Cure was his superior in ability, and certainly he was a
      greater man&mdash;though seemingly only a tailor&mdash;than M. Rossignol.
      M. Rossignol&mdash;she flushed. Who could have believed that the Seigneur
      would say those words to her this morning&mdash;to her, Rosalie Evanturel,
      who hadn't five hundred dollars to her name? That she should be asked to
      be Madame Rossignol! Confusion mingled with her simple pride, and she ran
      out into the street, to where her father sat listening to the medicine-man
      singing, in doubtful French:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "I am a waterman bold,
          Oh, I'm a waterman bold:
          But for my lass I have great fear,
          Yes, in the isles I have great fear,
          For she is young, and I am old,
          And she is bien gentille!"
</pre>
    <p>
      It was night now. The militia had departed, their Colonel roaring commands
      at them out of a little red drill-book; the older people had gone to their
      homes, but festive youth hovered round the booths and sideshows, the
      majority enjoying themselves at some expense in the medicine-man's
      encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Rosalie ran towards the crowd she turned a wistful glance to the
      tailor-shop. Not a sign of life there! She imagined M'sieu' to be at
      Vadrome Mountain, until, glancing round the crowd at the quack-doctor's
      wagon, she saw Jo Portugais gloomily watching the travelling tinker of
      human bodies. Evidently M'sieu' was not at Vadrome Mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not far from her. At the side of the road, under a huge maple-tree
      with wide-spreading branches, Charley stood and watched John Brown
      performing behind the flaring oil-lights stuck on poles round his wagon,
      his hat now on, now off; now singing a comic song in English&mdash;-'I
      found Y' in de Honeysuckle Paitch;' now a French chanson&mdash;'En
      Revenant de St. Alban;' now treating a stiff neck or a bent back, or
      giving momentary help to the palsy of an old man, or again making a
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley was in touch again with the old life, but in a kind of fantasy
      only&mdash;a staring, high-coloured dream. This man&mdash;John Brown&mdash;had
      gone down before his old ironical questioning, had been, indirectly, the
      means of disgracing his name. A step forward to that wagon, a word
      uttered, a look, and he would have to face again the life he had put by
      for ever, would have to meet a hard problem and settle it&mdash;to what
      misery and tragedy, who might say? Under this tree he was M. Mallard, the
      infidel tailor, whose life was slowly entering into the life of this place
      called Chaudiere, slowly being acted upon by habit, which, automatically
      repeated, at length becomes character. Out in that red light, before that
      garish wagon, he would be Charley Steele, barrister, 'flaneur', and fop,
      who, according to the world, had misused a wife, misled her brother,
      robbed widows and orphans, squandered a fortune, become drunkard and
      wastrel, and at last had lost his life in a disorderly tavern at the Cote
      Dorion. This man before him had contributed to his disgrace; but once he
      had contributed to John Brown's disgrace; and to-day he had saved John
      Brown's life. They were even.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the night before, all this morning, he had fought a fierce battle with
      his past&mdash;with a raging thirst. The old appetite had swept over him
      fiercely. All day he had moved in a fevered conflict, which had lifted him
      away from the small movements of everyday life into a region where only
      were himself and one strong foe, who tirelessly strove with him. In his
      old life he had never had a struggle of any sort. His emotions had been
      cloaked, his soul masked, there had been a film before his eyes, he had
      worn an armour of selfishness on a life which had no deep problems,
      because it had no deep feelings&mdash;a life never rising to the
      intellectual prowess for which it was fitted, save when under the stimulus
      of liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment he had waked from a long seven months' sleep in the hut on
      Vadrome Mountain, new deep feelings had come to him as he faced problems
      of life. Fighting had begun from that hour&mdash;a fighting which was
      putting his nature through bitter mortal exercises, yet, too, giving him a
      sense of being he had never known. He had now the sweetness of earning
      daily bread by the work of his hands; of giving to the poor, the needy,
      and the afflicted; of knowing for the first time in his life that he was
      not alone in the world. Out of the grey dawn of life a woman's voice had
      called to him; the look of her face had said to him: "Viens ici! Viens
      ici!"&mdash;"Come to me! Come to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But with that call there was the answer of his soul, the desolating cry of
      the dispossessed Lear&mdash;"&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not questioned himself concerning Rosalie&mdash;had dared not to do
      so. But now, as he stood under the great tree, within hand-touch of the
      old life, in imminent danger of being thrust back into it, the question of
      Rosalie came upon him with all the force of months of feeling behind it.
      Thus did he argue with himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I love her? And if I love her, what is to be done? Marry her, with a
      wife living? Marry her while charged with a wretched crime? Would that be
      love? But suppose I never were discovered, and we might live here for
      ever, I as 'Monsieur Mallard,' in peace and quiet all the days of our
      life? Would that be love?... Could there be love with a vital secret,
      like, a cloud between, out of which, at any hour, might spring discovery?
      Could I build our life upon a silence which must be a lie? Would I not
      have to face the question, Does any one know cause or just impediment why
      this woman should not be married to this man? Tell Rosalie all, and let
      the law separate myself and Kathleen? That would mean Billy's ruin and
      imprisonment, and Kathleen's shame, and it might not bring Rosalir. She is
      a Catholic, and her Church would not listen to it. Would I have the right
      to bring trouble into her life? To wrong one woman should seem enough for
      one lifetime!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant Rosalie, who had been on the outskirts of the crowd, moved
      into his line of vision. The glare from the lights fell on her face as she
      stood by her father's chair, looking curiously at the quack-doctor who,
      having sold many bottles of his medicines, noy picked up a guitar and
      began singing an old dialect chanson of Saintonge:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Voici, the day has come
          When Rosette leaves her home!
          With fear she walks in the sun,
          For Raoul is ninety year,
          And she not twenty-one.
          La petit' Rosette,
          She is not twenty-one.

          "He takes her by the hand,
          And to the church they go;
          By parents 'twas well meant,
          But is Rosette content?
          'Tis gold and ninety year
          She walks in the sun with fear,
          La petit' Rosette,
          Not twenty-one as yet!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Charley's eyes, which had watched her these months past, noted the
      deepening colour of the face, the glow in the eyes, the glances of keen
      but agitated interest towards the singer. He could not translate her
      looks; and she, on her part, had she been compelled to do so, could only
      have set down a confusion of sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Rosette she saw herself, Rosalie Evanturel; in the man "de
      quatre-vingt-dix ans," who was to marry this Rosette of Saintonge, she saw
      M. Rossignol. Disconcerting pictures of a possible life with the Seigneur
      flitted before her mind. She beheld herself, young, fresh-cheeked, with
      life beating high and all the impulses of youth panting to use, sitting at
      the head of the seigneury table. She saw herself in the great pew at Mass,
      stiff with dignity, old in the way of manorial pride&mdash;all laughter
      dead in her, all spring-time joy overshadowed by the grave decorum of the
      Manor, all the imagination of her dreaming spirit chilled by the presence
      of age, however kindly and quaint and cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered, and dropped her eyes upon the ground, as, to the laughter
      and giggling of old and young gathered round the wagon, the medicine-man
      sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "He takes her by the hand,
          And to her chamber fair&mdash;"
</pre>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly turning, she vanished into the night, followed by the
      feeble inquiry of her father's eyes, the anxious look in Charley's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley could not read her tale. He had, however, a hot impulse to follow
      and ask her if she would vanish from the scene if the medicine-man should
      sing of Rosette and a man of thirty, not ninety, years. The fight he had
      had all day with his craving for drink had made him feverish, and all his
      emotions&mdash;unregulated, under the command of his will only&mdash;were
      in high temperature. A reckless feeling seized him. He would go to
      Rosalie, look into her eyes, and tell her that he loved her, no matter
      what the penalty of fate. He had never loved a human being, and the sudden
      impulse to cry out in the new language was driving him to follow the girl
      whose spirit for ever called to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a step forward to follow her, but stopped short, recalled to
      caution and his danger by the voice of the medicine-man:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had a friend once&mdash;good fellow, bad fellow, cleverest chap I ever
      knew. Tremendous fop&mdash;ladies loved him&mdash;cheeks like roses&mdash;tongue
      like sulphuric acid. Beautiful to look at. Clothes like a fashion-plate&mdash;got
      any fashion-plates in Chaudiere? 'who's your tailor?'" he added, in the
      slang of the hour, with a loud laugh, then stopped suddenly and took off
      his hat. "I forgot," he added, with upturned eyes and a dramatic
      seriousness, "your tailor saved my life to-day-henceforth I am the friend
      of all tailors. Well, to continue. My friend that was&mdash;I call him my
      friend, though he ruined me and ruined others,&mdash;didn't mean to, but
      he did just the same,&mdash;he came to a bad end. But he was a great man
      while he lived. And what I'm coming to is this, the song he used to sing
      when, in youthful exuberance, we went on the war-path like our young
      friend over there"&mdash;he pointed to a young habitant farmer, who was
      trying hard to preserve equilibrium&mdash;"Brown's Golden Pectoral will
      cure that cough, my friend!" he added, as the young man, gloomily ashamed
      of the laughter of the crowd, hiccoughed and turned away to the tree under
      which Charley Steele stood. "Well," he went on, "I was going to say that
      my friend's name was Charley, and the song he used to sing when the
      roosters waked the morn was called 'Champagne Charlie.' He was called
      'Champagne Charlie'&mdash;till he came to a bad end."
    </p>
    <p>
      He twanged his guitar, cleared his throat, winked at Maximilian Cour the
      baker, and began:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "The way I gained my title's by a hobby which I've got
     Of never letting others pay, however long the shot;
     Whoever drinks at my expense is treated all the same;
     Whoever calls himself my friend, I make him drink champagne.
     Some epicures like Burgundy, Hock, Claret, and Moselle,
     But Moet's vintage only satisfies this champagne swell.
     What matter if I go to bed and head is muddled thick,
     A bottle in the morning sets me right then very quick.
     Champagne Charlie is my name;
     Champagne Charlie is my name.
     Who's the man with the heart so young,
     Who's the man with the ginger tongue?
     Champagne Charlie is his name!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Under the tree, Charley Steele listened to this jaunty epitaph on his old
      self. At the first words of the coarse song there rushed on him the
      dreaded thirst. He felt his veins beating with desire, with anger,
      disgust, and shame; for there was John Brown, to the applause of the
      crowd, imitating his old manner, his voice, his very look. He started
      forward, but the drunken young habitant lurched sideways under the tree
      and collapsed upon the ground, a bottle of whiskey falling out of his
      pocket and rolling almost to his own feet.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Champagne Charlie is my name,"
</pre>
    <p>
      sang the medicine-man. All Charley's old life surged up in him as dyked
      water suddenly bursts bounds and spreads destruction. He had an
      uncontrollable impulse. As a starving animal snatches at the first food
      offered it, he stooped, with a rattle in his throat, seized the bottle,
      uncorked it, put it to his lips, and drank&mdash;drank&mdash;drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned and plunged away into the trees. The sound of the song
      followed him. It came to him, the last refrain, sung loudly to the
      laughter of the crowd, in imitation of his own voice as it used to be&mdash;it
      had been a different voice during this past year. He turned with headlong
      intention, and, as the last notes of the song and the applause that
      followed it, died away, threw back his head and sang out of the darkness:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Champagne Charlie is my name&mdash;"
</pre>
    <p>
      With a shrill laugh, like the half-mad cry of an outcast soul, he flung
      away farther into the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden silence. The crowd turned with half-apprehensive
      laughter to the trees. Upon John Brown the effect was startling. His face
      blanched, his eyes grew large with terror, his mouth opened in helpless
      agitation. Charley Steele was lying under the waters of the great river,
      his bones rotting there for a year, yet here was his voice coming out of
      the night, in response to his own grotesque imitation of the dead man.
      Seeing his agitation, women turned pale, men felt their flesh creep,
      imagination gave a thrilling coldness to the air. For a moment the silence
      was unbroken. Then John Brown stretched out his hand and said, in a hoarse
      whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was his voice&mdash;Charley's voice, and he's been dead a year!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Within half-an-hour, in utter collapse and fright, he was being driven to
      the next parish by two young habitants whom he paid to accompany him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. OUT ON THE OLD TRAIL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was one person in the crowd surrounding the medicine-man's wagon who
      had none of that superstitious thrill which had scattered the habitants
      into little awe-stricken groups, and then by twos and threes to their
      homes; none of that fear which had reduced the quack-doctor to such
      nervous collapse that he would not spend the night in the village. Jo
      Portugais had recognised the voice&mdash;that of Charley Steele the lawyer
      who had saved him from hanging years ago. It was little like the voice of
      M'sieu'! There was that in it which frightened him. He waited until he had
      seen the quackdoctor start for the next parish, then he went slowly down
      the street. There were people still about, so he walked on towards the
      river. When he returned, the street was empty. Keeping in the shadow of
      the trees, he went to Charley's house. There was a light in a window. He
      went to the back door and tried it. It was not locked, and, without
      knocking, he stepped inside the kitchen. Here was no light, and he passed
      into the hallway and on to a little room opening from the tailorshop. He
      knocked; then, not waiting for response, opened the door and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley was standing before a mirror, holding a pair of scissors. He
      turned abruptly, and said forbiddingly: "I am at my toilet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning again to the mirror, with a shrug of the shoulders, he
      raised the shears to his beard. Before he could use them, Jo's hand was on
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop that, M'sieu'!" he said huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley had drunk nearly a whole bottle of cheap whiskey within an hour.
      He was intoxicated, but, as had ever been the case with him, his brain was
      working clearly, his hand was steady; he was in that wide dream of
      clear-seeing and clear-knowing which, in old days, had given him glimpses
      of the real life from which, in the egotism of the non-intime, he had been
      shut out. Looking at Jo now, he was possessed by a composed intoxication
      like that in which he had moved during that last night at the Cote Dorion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, with the baleful crust of egotism gone, with every nerve of life
      exposed, with conscience struggling to its feet from the torpor of
      thirty-odd vacant years, he was as two men in one, with different lives
      and different souls, yet as inseparable in their misery as those poor
      victims of Gallic tyranny, chained back to back and thrown into the Seine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo's words, insistent and eager, suddenly roused in him some old memory,
      which stayed his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I stop?" he asked quietly, and smiling that smile which had
      infuriated the river-drivers at the Cote Dorion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going back, M'sieu?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back where?" Charley's eyes were fixed on Jo with a penetrating
      intensity, heightened to a strange abstraction, as though he saw not Jo
      alone, but something great distances beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo did not answer this question directly. "Some one came to-day&mdash;he
      is gone; some one may come to-morrow&mdash;and stay," he said meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley went over to the fire and sat down on a bench, opening and
      shutting the scissors mechanically. Jo was in the light, and Charley's
      eyes again studied him hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      His memory was industriously feeling its way into the baffling distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What if some one did come-and stay?" he urged quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might be recognised without the beard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What difference would it make?" Charley's memory was creeping close to
      the hidden door. It was feeling-feeling for the latch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know best, M'sieu'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what do you know?" Charley's face now had a strained look, and he
      touched his lips with his tongue. "What John Brown knows, M'sieu'."
    </p>
    <p>
      There flashed across Charley's mind the fatal newspaper he had read on the
      day he awakened to memory again in the but on Vadrome Mountain. He
      remembered that he had put it in the fire. But Jo might have read it
      before it was spread upon the bench-put it there of purpose for him to
      read. Yet what reason could Jo have for being silent, for hiding his
      secret?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a space, in which Charley's eyes were like unmoving
      sparks of steel. He did not see Jo's face&mdash;it was in a mist&mdash;he
      was searching, searching, searching. All at once he felt the latch of the
      hidden door under his finger; he saw a court-room, a judge and jury, and
      hundreds of excited faces, himself standing in the midst. He saw twelve
      men file slowly into the room and take their seats-all save one, who stood
      still in his place and said: "Not guilty, your Honour!" He saw the
      prisoner leave the box and step down a free man. He saw himself coming out
      into the staring summer day. He watched the prisoner come to him and touch
      his arm, and say: "Thank you, M'sieu'. You have saved my life." He saw
      himself turn to this man:
    </p>
    <p>
      He roused from his trance, he staggered to his feet, the shears rattled to
      the floor. Lurching forward, he caught Jo Portugais by the throat, and
      said, as he had said outside the court-room years ago:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get out of my sight. You're as guilty as hell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His grip tightened&mdash;tightened on Jo's throat. Jo did not move, though
      his face grew black. Then, suddenly, the hands relaxed, a bluish paleness
      swept over the face, and Charley fell sidewise to the floor before Jo
      could catch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night, alone, the murderer struggled with death over the body of the
      lawyer who had saved his life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. THE SEIGNEUR GIVES A WARNING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rosalie had watched a shut door for five days&mdash;a door from which, for
      months past, had come all the light and glow of her life. It framed a
      figure which had come to represent to her all that meant hope and soul and
      conscience-and love. The morning after St. Jean Baptiste's day she had
      awaited the opening door, but it had remained closed. Ensued watchful
      hours, and then from Jo Portugais she had learned that M'sieu' had been
      ill and near to death. She had been told the weird story of the
      medicine-man and the ghostly voice, and, without reason, she took the
      incident as a warning, and associated it with the man across the way. She
      was come of a superstitious race, and she herself had heard and seen
      things of which she never had been able to speak&mdash;the footsteps in
      the church the night she had screwed the little cross to the door again;
      the tiny round white light by the door of the church; the hood which had
      vanished into the unknown. One mystery fed another. It seemed to her as if
      some dreadful event were forward; and all day she kept her eyes fixed on
      the tailor's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead&mdash;if M'sieu' should die! If M'sieu' should die&mdash;it needed
      all her will to prevent herself from going over and taking things in her
      own hands, being his nurse, his handmaid, his slave. Duty&mdash;to the
      government, to her father? Her heart cried out that her duty lay where all
      her life was eddying to one centre. What would the world say? She was not
      concerned for that, save for him. What, then, would M'sieu' say? That gave
      her pause. The Seigneur's words the day before had driven her back upon a
      tide of emotions which carried her far out upon that sea where reason and
      life's conventions are derelicts, where Love sails with reckless courage
      down the shoreless main.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could only be near him!" she kept saying to herself. "It is my
      right. I would give my life, my soul for his. I was with him before when
      his life was in danger. It was my hand that saved him. It was my love that
      tended him. It was my soul that kept his secret. It was my faith that
      spoke for him. It was my heart that ached for him. It is my heart that
      aches for him now as none other in all the world can. No one on earth
      could care as I care. Who could there be?" Something whispered in her ear,
      "Kathleen!" The name haunted her, as the little cross had done. Misery and
      anger possessed her, and she fought on with herself through dark hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus five days had gone, until at last a wagon was brought to the door of
      the tailor-shop, and M'sieu' came out, leaning on the arm of Jo Portugais.
      There were several people in the street at the time, and they kept
      whispering that M'sieu' had been at death's door. He was pale and haggard,
      with dark hollows under the eyes. Just as he got into the wagon the Cure
      came up. They shook hands. The Cure looked him earnestly in the face, his
      lips moved, but no one could have told what he said. As the wagon started,
      Charley looked across to the post-office. Rosalie was standing a little
      back from the door, but she stepped forward now. Their eyes met. Her heart
      beat faster, for there was a look in his eyes she had never seen before&mdash;a
      look of human helplessness, of deep anxiety. It was meant for her&mdash;for
      herself alone. She could not trust herself to go and speak to him. She
      felt that she must burst into tears. So, with a look of pity and pain, she
      watched the wagon go down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat!&mdash;the Seigneur's gold-headed cane rattled on the
      front door of the tailor-shop. It was plain to be seen his business was
      urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Dauphin came hurrying from the postoffice, followed by Maximilian
      Cour and Filion Lacasse. "Ah, M'sieu', the tailor will not answer. There's
      no use knocking&mdash;not a bit, M'sieu' Rossignol," said Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur turned querulously upon the Notary's wife, yet with a glint
      of hard humour in his eye. He had no love for Madame Dauphin. He thought
      she took unfair advantages of M. Dauphin, whom also he did not love, but
      whose temperament did him credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How should Madame know whether or no the gentleman will answer? Does
      Madame share the gentleman's confidence, perhaps?" he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame did not reply at once. She turned on the saddler and the baker. "I
      hope you'll learn a lesson," she cried triumphantly. "I've always said the
      tailor was quite the gentleman; and now you see how your betters call him.
      No, M'sieu', the gentleman will not answer," she added to the Seigneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is in bed yet, Madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His bed is empty there, M'sieu'," she said, impressively, and pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I should trust you in this matter; I suppose you should know.
      But, Dauphin&mdash;what does Dauphin say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The saddler laughed outright. Maximilian Cour suddenly blushed in sympathy
      with Madame Dauphin, who now saw the drift of the Seigneur's remarks, and
      was sensibly agitated, as the Seigneur had meant her to be. Had she not
      turned Dauphin's human sympathies into a crime? Had not the Notary
      supported the Seigneur in his friendly offices to Paulette Dubois; and had
      not Madame troubled her husband's life because of it? Madame bridled up
      now&mdash;with discretion, for it was not her cue to offend the Seigneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the village knows his bed's empty there, M'sieu'," she said, with
      tightening lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am subtracted from the total, then?" he asked drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been away for the last five days&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, now, how did you know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everybody knows it. You went away with the Colonel and the soldiers on
      St. Jean Baptiste's day. Since then M'sieu' the tailor has been ill. I
      should think Mrs. Flynn would have told you that, M'sieu'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "H'm! Would you? Well, Mrs. Flynn has been away too&mdash;and you didn't
      know that! What is the matter with Monsieur Mallard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some kind of fever. On St. Jean Baptiste's day he was taken ill, and that
      animal Portugais took care of him all night&mdash;I wonder how M'sieu' can
      have the creature about! That St. Jean Baptiste's night was an awful
      night. Have you heard of what happened, M'sieu'? Ghost or no ghost&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, I want to know about the tailor, not of ghosts," impatiently
      interrupted the Seigneur. "Tiens! M'sieu', the tailor was ill for three
      days here, and he would let no one except the Cure and Jo Portugais near
      him. I went myself to clean up and make some broth, but that toad of a
      Portugais shut the door in my face. The Cure told us to go home and leave
      M'sieu' with Portugais. He must be very sick to have that black sheep
      about him&mdash;and no doctor either."
    </p>
    <p>
      The saddler spoke up now. "I took him a bottle of good brandy and some
      buttermilk-pop and seed cake&mdash;I would give him a saddle if he had a
      horse&mdash;he got my thousand dollars for me! Well, he took them, but
      what do you think? He sent them right off to the shantyman, Gugon, who has
      a broken leg. Infidel or no, I'm on his side for sure. And God blesses a
      cheerful giver, I'm told."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the baker's chance, and he took it. "I played 'The Heart Bowed
      Down'-it is English-under his window, two nights ago, and he sent word for
      me to come and play it again in the kitchen. Ah, that is a good song, 'The
      Heart Bowed Down.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd be a better baker if you fiddled less," said Madame Dauphin,
      annoyed at being dropped out of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The soul must be fed, Madame," rejoined the baker, with asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the tailor now?" said the Seigneur shortly. "At Portugais's on
      Vadrome Mountain. They say he looked like a ghost when he went. Rosalie
      Evanturel saw him, but she has no tongue in her head this morning," added
      Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur moved away. "Good-bye to you&mdash;I am obliged to you,
      Madame. Good-bye, Lacasse. Come and fiddle to me some night, Cour."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to the obsequious three, and then bent his steps towards the
      post-office. They seemed about to follow him, but he stopped them with a
      look. The men raised their bonnets-rouges, the woman bowed low, and the
      Seigneur entered the post-office door.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the shadows of the office Rosalie had watched the little group before
      the door of the tailor-shop. She saw the Seigneur coming across the
      street. Suddenly she flushed deeply, for there came to her mind the song
      the quack-doctor sang:

            "Voila, the day has come
             When Rosette leaves her home!
             With fear she walks in the sun,
             For Raoul is ninety year,
             And she not twenty-one."
</pre>
    <p>
      As M. Rossignol's figure darkened the doorway, she pretended to be busy
      behind the wicket, and not to see him. He was not sure, but he thought it
      quite possible that she had seen him coming, and he put her embarrassment
      down to shyness. Naturally the poor child was not given the chance every
      day to receive an offer of marriage from a seigneur. He had made up his
      mind that she would be sure to accept him if he asked her a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Ma'm'selle Rosalie," he said gaily, "what have you to say that you
      should not come before a magistrate at once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, if Monsieur Rossignol is to be the magistrate," she replied,
      with forced lightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" He looked at her quizzically through his gold-handled glass. "I
      can't frighten you, I see. Well, you must wait a little; you shall be
      sworn in postmistress in three days." His voice lowered, became more
      serious. "Tell me," he said, "do you know what is the matter with the
      gentleman across the way?" Turning, he looked across to the tailor-shop,
      as though he expected "the gentleman" to appear, and he did not see her
      turn pale. When his look fell on her again, she was self-controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been opposite him here these months past&mdash;did you ever see
      anything not&mdash;not as it should be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With him, Monsieur? Never."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is as though the infidel behaved like a good Catholic and a
      Christian?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are good Catholics in Chaudiere who do not behave like Christians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you say, for instance, about his past?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What should I say about his past, Monsieur? What should I know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should know more than any one else in Chaudiere. The secrets of his
      breast might well be bared to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She started and crimsoned. Before her eyes there came a mist obscuring the
      Seigneur, and for an instant shutting out the world. The secrets of his
      breast&mdash;what did he mean? Did he know that on Monsieur's breast was
      the red scar which...
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Rossignol's voice seemed coming from an infinite distance, and as it
      came, the mist slowly passed from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will know, Mademoiselle Rosalie," he was saying, "that while I
      suggested that the secrets of his breast might well be bared to you, I
      meant that as an honest lady and faithful postmistress they were not. It
      was my awkward joke&mdash;a stupid gambolling by an old man who ought to
      know better."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, and he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that you are trusted. Pray accept my apologies."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was herself again. "Monsieur," she said quietly; "I know nothing of
      his past. I want to know nothing. It does not seem to me that it is my
      business. The world is free for a man to come and go in, if he keeps the
      law and does no ill&mdash;is it not? But, in any case, I know nothing.
      Since you have said so much, I shall say this, and betray no 'secrets of
      his breast'&mdash;that he has received no letter through this office since
      the day he first came from Vadrome Mountain."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur smiled. "A wonderful tailor! How does he carry on business
      without writing letters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was a large stock of everything left by Louis Trudel, and not long
      ago a commercial traveller was here with everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think he has nothing to hide, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have not we all something to hide&mdash;with or without shame?" she asked
      simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have more sense than any woman in Chaudiere, Mademoiselle."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, yet she raised her eyes gratefully to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I put faith in what you say," he continued. "Now listen. My brother, the
      Abbe, chaplain to the Archbishop, is coming here. He has heard of 'the
      infidel' of our parish. He is narrow and intolerant&mdash;the Abbe. He is
      going to stir up trouble against the tailor. We are a peaceful people
      here, and like to be left alone. We are going on very well as we are. So I
      wanted to talk to Monsieur to-day. I must make up my own mind how to act.
      The tailor-shop is the property of the Church. An infidel occupies it, so
      it is said; the Abbe does not like that. I believe there are other curious
      suspicions about Monsieur: that he is a robber, or incendiary, or
      something of the sort. The Abbe may take a stand, and the Cure's position
      will be difficult. What is more, my brother has friends here, fanatics
      like himself. He has been writing to them. They are men capable of doing
      unpleasant things&mdash;the Abbe certainly is. It is fair to warn the
      tailor. Shall I leave it to you? Do not frighten him. But there is no
      doubt he should be warned&mdash;fair play, fair play! I hear nothing but
      good of him from those whose opinions I value. But, you see, every man's
      history in this parish and in every parish of the province is known. This
      man, for us, has no history. The Cure even admits there are some grounds
      for calling him an infidel, but, as you know, he would keep the man here,
      not drive him out from among us. I have not told the Cure about the Abbe
      yet. I wished first to talk with you. The Abbe may come at any moment. I
      have been away, and only find his letters to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish me to tell Monsieur?" interrupted Rosalie, unable to hold
      silence any longer. More than once during the Seigneur's disclosure she
      had felt that she must cry out and fiercely repel the base insinuations
      against the man she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would do it with discretion. You are friendly with him, are you not?&mdash;you
      talk with him now and then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She inclined her head. "Very well, Monsieur. I will go to Vadrome Mountain
      to-morrow," she said quietly. Anger, apprehension, indignation, possessed
      her, but she held herself firmly. The Seigneur was doing a friendly thing;
      and, in any case, she could have no quarrel with him. There was danger to
      the man she loved, however, and every faculty was alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right. He shall have his chance to evade the Abbe if he wishes,"
      answered M. Rossignol.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, in which she was scarcely conscious of his
      presence; then he leaned over the counter towards her, and spoke in a low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I said the other day I meant. I do not change my mind&mdash;I am too
      old for that. Yet I'm young enough to know that you may change yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot change, Monsieur," she said tremblingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you will change. I knew your mother well, I know how anxious she was
      for your future. I told her once that I should keep an eye on you always.
      Her father was my father's good friend. I knew you when you were in the
      cradle&mdash;a little brown-haired babe. I watched you till you went to
      the convent. I saw you come back to take up the duties which your mother
      laid down, alas!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur&mdash;!" she said choking, and with a troubled little gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must let me speak, Rosalie. We got your father this post-office. It
      is a poor living, but it keeps a roof over your head. You have never
      failed us you have always fulfilled our hopes. But the best years of your
      life are going, and your education and your nature have not their chance.
      Oh, I've not watched you all these years for nothing. I never meant to ask
      you to marry me. It came to me, though, all at once, and I know that it
      has been in my mind all these years&mdash;far back in my mind. I don't ask
      you for my own sake alone. Your father may grow very ill&mdash;who can
      tell what may happen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be postmistress still," she said sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a young girl you could not have the responsibility here alone. And you
      should not waste your life it is a fine, full spirit; let the lean, the
      poor-spirited, go singly. You should be mated. You can't marry any of the
      young farmers of Chaudiere. 'Tis impossible. I can give you enough for any
      woman's needs&mdash;the world may be yours to see and use to your heart's
      content. I can give, too"&mdash;he drew himself up proudly&mdash;"the
      unused emotions of a lifetime." This struck him as a very fine and
      important thing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Monsieur, that is not enough," she responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What more can you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up with a tearful smile. "I will tell you one day, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not picked it out in the calendar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fix the day, and I will wait till then. I will not open my mouth again
      till then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Michaelmas day, then, Monsieur," she answered mechanically and at
      haphazard, but with an urged gaiety, for a great depression was on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Till Michaelmas day, then!" He pulled his long nose, laughing
      silently.... "I leave the tailor in your hands. Give every man his chance,
      I say. The Abbe is a hard man, but our hearts are soft&mdash;eh, eh, very
      soft!" He raised his hat and turned to the door.

      CHAPTER XXIX. THE WILD RIDE
    </h2>
    <p>
      There had been a fierce thunder-storm in the valley of the Chaudiere. It
      had come suddenly from the east, had shrieked over the village, levelling
      fences, carrying away small bridges, and ending in a pelting hail, which
      whitened the ground with pebbles of ice. It had swept up to Vadrome
      Mountain, and had marched furiously through the forest, carrying down
      hundreds of trees, drowning the roars of wild animals and the crying and
      fluttering of birds. One hour of ravage and rage, and then, spent and
      bodiless, the storm crept down the other side of the mountain and into the
      next parish, whither the affrighted quack-doctor had betaken himself.
      After, a perfect calm, a shining sun, and a sweet smell over all the land,
      which had thirstily drunk the battering showers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the house on Vadrome Mountain the tailor of Chaudiere had watched the
      storm with sympathetic interest. It was in accord with his own feelings.
      He had had a hard fight for months past, and had gone down in the storm of
      his emotions one night when a song called Champagne Charlie had had a
      weird and thrilling antiphonal. There had been a subsequent debacle for
      himself, and then a revelation concerning Jo Portugais. Ensued hours and
      days, wherein he had fought a desperate fight with the present&mdash;with
      himself and the reaction from his dangerous debauch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle for his life had been fought for him by this gloomy woodsman
      who henceforth represented his past, was bound to him by a measureless
      gratitude, almost a sacrament&mdash;of the damned. Of himself he had
      played no conscious part in it till the worst was over. On the one side
      was the Cure, patient, gentle, friendly, never pushing forward the Faith
      which the good man dreamed should give him refuge and peace; on the other
      side was the murderer, who typified unrest, secretiveness, an awful
      isolation, and a remorse which had never been put into words or acts of
      restitution. For six days the tailor-shop and the life at Chaudiere had
      been things almost apart from his consciousness. Ever-recurring memories
      of Rosalie Evanturel were driven from his mind with a painful persistence.
      In the shadows where his nature dwelt now he would not allow her good
      innocence and truth to enter. His self-reproach was the more poignant
      because it was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching the tempest-swept valley, the tortured forest, where wild life
      was in panic, there came upon him the old impulse to put his thoughts into
      words, "and so be rid of them," as he was wont to say in other days.
      Taking from his pocket some slips of paper, he laid them on the table
      before him. Three or four times he leaned over the paper to write, but the
      noise of the storm again and again drew his look to the window. The
      tempest ceased almost as suddenly as it had come, and, as the first
      sunlight broke through the flying clouds, he mechanically lifted a sheet
      of the paper and held it up to the light. It brought to his eyes the large
      water-mark, Kathleen!
    </p>
    <p>
      A sombre look passed over his face, he shifted in his chair, then bent
      over the paper and began to write. Words flowed from his pen. The lines of
      his face relaxed, his eyes lightened; he was lost in a dream. He thought
      of the present, and he wrote:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Wave walls to seaward,
          Storm-clouds to leeward,
          Beaten and blown by the winds of the West;
          Sail we encumbered
          Past isles unnumbered,
          But never to greet the green island of Rest."
</pre>
    <p>
      He thought of Father Loisel. He had seen the good man's lips tremble at
      some materialistic words he had once used in their many talks, and he
      wrote:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
            "Lips that now tremble,
             Do you dissemble
          When you deny that the human is best?&mdash;
             Love, the evangel,
             Finds the Archangel?
          Is that a truth when this may be a jest?

            "Star-drifts that glimmer
             Dimmer and dimmer,
          What do ye know of my weal or my woe?
             Was I born under
             The sun or the thunder?
          What do I come from? and where do I go?

            "Rest, shall it ever
             Come? Is endeavour
          But a vain twining and twisting of cords?
             Is faith but treason;
             Reason, unreason,
          But a mechanical weaving of words?"
</pre>
    <p>
      He thought of Louis Trudel, in his grave, and his own questioning: "Show
      me a sign from Heaven, tailorman!" and he wrote:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
            "What is the token,
             Ever unbroken,
          Swept down the spaces of querulous years,
             Weeping or singing
             That the Beginning
          Of all things is with us, and sees us, and hears?"
</pre>
    <p>
      He made an involuntary motion of his hand to his breast, where old Louis
      Trudel had set a sign. So long as he lived, it must be there to read: a
      shining smooth scar of excoriation, a sacred sign of the faith he had
      never been able to accept; of which he had never, indeed, been able to
      think, so distant had been his soul, until, against his will, his heart
      had answered to the revealing call in a woman's eyes. He felt her fingers
      touch his breast as they did that night the iron seared him; and out of
      this first intimacy of his soul he wrote:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
            "What is the token?
             Bruised and broken,
          Bend I my life to a blossoming rod?
             Shall then the worst things
             Come to the first things,
          Finding the best of all, last of all, God?"
</pre>
    <p>
      Like the cry of his "Aphrodite," written that last afternoon of the old
      life, this plaint ended with the same restless, unceasing question. But
      there was a difference. There was no longer the material, distant note of
      a pagan mind; there was the intimate, spiritual note of a mind finding a
      foothold on the submerged causeway of life and time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he folded up the paper to put it into his pocket, Jo Portugais entered
      the room. He threw in a corner the wet bag which had protected his
      shoulders from the rain, hung his hat on a peg of the chimney-piece,
      nodded to Charley, and put a kettle on the little fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A big storm, M'sieu'," Jo said presently as he put some tea into a pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never seen a great storm in a forest before," answered Charley,
      and came nearer to the window through which the bright sun streamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It always does me good," said Jo. "Every bird and beast is awake and
      afraid and trying to hide, and the trees fall, and the roar of it like the
      roar of the chasse-galerie on the Kimash River."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Kimash River&mdash;where is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo shrugged his shoulders. "Who knows!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it a legend, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a river."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the chasse-galerie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true, M'sieu', no matter what any one thinks. I know; I have seen&mdash;I
      have seen with my own eyes." Jo was excited now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am listening." He took a cup of tea from Portugais and drank eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Kimash River, M'sieu', that is the river in the air. On it is the
      chasse-galerie. You sell your soul to the devil; you ask him to help you;
      you deny God. You get into a canoe and call on the devil. You are lifted
      up, canoe and all, and you rush on down rapids, over falls, on the Kimash
      River in the air. The devil stands behind you and shouts, and you sing,
      'V'la! l'bon vent! V'la l'joli vent!' On and on you go, faster and faster,
      and you forget the world, and you forget yourself, and the devil is with
      you in the air&mdash;in the chasse-galerie on the Kimash River."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jo," said Charley Steele, "do you honestly think there's a river like
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'M'sieu', I know it. I saw Ignace Latoile, who robbed a priest and got
      drunk on the communion wine&mdash;I saw him with the devil in the Black
      Canoe at the Saguenay. I could see Ignace; I could see the devil; I could
      see the Kimash River. I shall ride myself some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ride where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does it matter where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should you ride?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you ride fast with the devil."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the good of riding fast?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the rush a man forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he forget, my friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, in which a man with a load of crime upon his soul dwelt
      upon the words my friend, coming from the lips of one who knew the fulness
      of his iniquity. Then he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the noise he forget that a voice is calling in his ear, 'You did It!'
      He forget what he see in his dreams. He forget the hand that touch him on
      the arm when he walk in the woods alone, or lie down to sleep at night, no
      one near. He forget that some one wait&mdash;wait&mdash;wait, till he has
      suffer long enough, or till, one day, he think he is happy again, and the
      Thing he did is far off like a dream&mdash;to drag him out to the death he
      did not die. He forget that he is alone&mdash;all alone in the world, for
      ever and ever and ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly sank upon the floor beside Charley, and a groan burst from his
      lips. "To have no friend&mdash;ah, it is so awful!" he said. "Never to see
      a face that look into yours, and know how bad are you, and doesn't mind.
      For five years I have live like that. I cannot let any one be my friend
      because I was that! They seem to know&mdash;everything, everybody&mdash;what
      I am. The little children when I pass them run away to hide. I have wake
      in the night and cry out in fear, it is so lonely. I have hear voices
      round me in the woods, and I run and run and run from them, and not leave
      them behind. Three times I go to the jails in Quebec to see the prisoners
      behind the bars, and watch the pains on their faces, to understand what I
      escape. Five times have I go to the courts to listen to murderers tried,
      and watch them when the Jury say Guilty! and the Judge send them to death&mdash;that
      I might know. Twice have I go to see murderers hung. Once I was helper to
      the hangman, that I might hear and know what the man said, what he felt.
      When the arms were bound, I felt the straps on my own; when the cap come
      down, I gasp for breath; when the bolt is shot, I feel the wrench and the
      choke, and shudder go through myself&mdash;feel the world jerk out in the
      dark. When the body is bundled in the pit, I see myself lie still under
      the quick-lime with the red mark round my throat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley touched him on the shoulder. "Jo&mdash;poor Jo, my friend!" he
      said. Jo raised his eyes, red with an unnatural fire, deep with gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I sit at my dinner, with the sun shining and the woods green and glad,
      and all the world gay, I have see what happened all over again. I have see
      his strong hands; his bad face laugh at my words; I have see him raise his
      riding-whip and cut me across the head. I have see him stagger and fall
      from the blows I give him with the knife&mdash;the knife which never was
      found&mdash;why, I not know, for I throw it on the ground beside him!
      There, as I sit in the open day, a thousand times I have see him shiver
      and fall, staring, staring at me as if he see a dreadful thing. Then I
      stand up again and strike at him&mdash;at his ghost!&mdash;as I did that
      day in the woods. Again I see him lie in his blood, straight and white&mdash;so
      large, so handsome, so still! I have shed tears&mdash;but what are tears!
      Blind with tears I have call out for the devils of hell to take me with
      them. I have call on God to give me death. I have prayed, and I have
      cursed. Twice I have travelled to the grave where he lies. I have knelt
      there and have beg him to tell the truth to God, and say that he torture
      me till I kill him. I have beg him to forgive me and to haunt me no more
      with his bad face. But never&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;have I one
      quiet hour until you come, M'sieu'; nor any joy in my heart till I tell
      you the black truth&mdash;M'sieu'! M'sieu!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He buried his face between Charley's feet, and held them with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley laid a hand on the shaggy head as though it were that of a child.
      "Be still&mdash;be still, Jo," he said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that night of St. Jean Baptiste's festival, no word of the past, of
      the time when Charley turned aside the revanche of justice from a man
      called Joseph Nadeau, had been spoken between them. Out of the delirium of
      his drunken trance had come Charley's recognition of the man he knew now
      as Jo Portugais. But the recognition had been sent again into the
      obscurity whence it came, and had not been mentioned since. To outward
      seeming they had gone on as before. As Charley saw the knotted brows, the
      staring eyes, the clinched hands, the figure of the woodsman rigid in its
      agony of remorse, he said to himself: "What right had I to save this man's
      life? To have paid for his crime would have been easier for him. I knew he
      was guilty. Perhaps it was my duty to see that every condition, to the
      last shade of the law, was satisfied, but was it justice to the poor devil
      himself? There he sits with a load on him that weighs him down every hour
      of his life. I called him back; I gave him life; but I gave him memory and
      remorse, and the ghosts that haunt him: the voice in his ear, the touch on
      his arm, the some one that is 'waiting&mdash;waiting&mdash;waiting!' That
      is what I did, and that is what the brother of the Cure did for me. He
      drew me back. He knew I was a drunkard, but he drew me back. I might have
      been a murderer like Portugais. The world says I was a thief, and a thief
      I am until I prove to the world I am innocent&mdash;and wreck three lives!
      How much of Jo's guilt is guilt? How much remorse should a man suffer to
      pay the debt of a life? If the law is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
      tooth, how much hourly remorse and torture, such as Jo's, should balance
      the eye or the tooth or the life? I wonder, now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned over, and, helping Jo to his feet, gently forced him down upon a
      bench near. "All right, Jo, my friend," he said. "I understand. We'll
      drink the gall together."
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat and looked at each other in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Charley leaned over and touched Jo on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you want to save yourself?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant there was a knock at the door, and a voice said:
      "Monsieur!&mdash;Monsieur!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo sprang to his feet with a sharp exclamation, then went heavily to the
      door and threw it open.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. ROSALIE WARNS CHARLEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Charley's eyes met Rosalie's with a look the girl had never seen in them
      before. It gave a glow to his haggard face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie turned to Jo and greeted him with a friendlier manner than was her
      wont towards him. The nearer she was to Charley, the farther away from
      him, to her mind, was Portugais, and she became magnanimous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo nodded' awkwardly and left the room. Looking after the departing
      figure, Rosalie said: "I know he has been good to you, but&mdash;but do
      you trust him, Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does not everybody in Chaudiere trust him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is one who does not, though perhaps that's of no consequence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you not trust him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I never knew him do a bad thing; I never heard of a bad
      thing he has done; and&mdash;he has been good to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, flushing as she felt the significance of her words, and
      continued: "Yet there is&mdash;I cannot tell what. I feel something. It is
      not reasonable to go upon one's feelings; but there it is, and so I do not
      trust him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the way he lives, here in these lonely woods&mdash;the mystery
      around him."
    </p>
    <p>
      A change passed over her. With the first glow of meeting the object of her
      visit had receded, though since her last interview with the Seigneur she
      had not rested a moment, in her anxiety to warn him of his danger. "Oh,
      no," she said, lifting her eyes frankly to his: "oh, no, Monsieur! It is
      not that. There is mystery about you!" She felt her heart beating hard. It
      almost choked her, but she kept on bravely. "People say strange and bad
      things about you. No one knows"&mdash;she trembled under the painful
      inquiry of his eyes. Then she gained courage and went on, for she must
      make it clear she trusted him, that she took him at his word, before she
      told him of the peril before him&mdash;"No one knows where you came
      from... and it is nobody's business. Some people do not believe in you.
      But I believe in you&mdash;I should believe in you if every one doubted;
      for there is no feeling in me that says, 'He has done some wicked thing
      that stands-between us.' It isn't the same as with Portugais, you see&mdash;naturally,
      it could not be the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed not to realise that she was telling more of her own heart than
      she had ever told. It was a revelation, having its origin in an honesty
      which impelled a pure outspokenness to himself. Reserve, of course, there
      had been elsewhere, for did not she hold a secret with him? Had she not
      hidden things, equivocated else where? Yet it had been at his wish, to
      protect the name of a dead man, for the repose of whose soul masses were
      now said, with expensive candles burning. For this she had no repentance;
      she was without logic where this man's good was at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley had before him a problem, which he now knew he never could evade
      in the future. He could solve it by none of the old intellectual means,
      but by the use of new faculties, slowly emerging from the unexplored
      fastnesses of his nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should you believe in me?" he asked, forcing himself to smile, yet
      acutely alive to the fact that a crisis was impending. "You, like all down
      there in Chaudiere, know nothing of my past, are not sure that I haven't
      been a hundred times worse than you think poor Jo there. I may have been
      anything. You may be harbouring a man the law is tracking down."
    </p>
    <p>
      In all that befell Rosalie Evanturel thereafter, never could come such
      another great resolute moment. There was nothing to support her in the
      crisis but her own faith. It needed high courage to tell this man who had
      first given her dreams, then imagination, hope, and the beauty of doing
      for another's well-being rather than for her own&mdash;to tell this man
      that he was a suspected criminal. Would he hate her? Would his kindness
      turn to anger? Would he despise her for even having dared to name the
      suspicion which was bringing hither an austere Abbe and officers of the
      law?
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are harbouring a man the law is tracking down," she said with an
      infinite appeal in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not quite understand. He thought that perhaps she meant Jo, and he
      glanced towards the door; but she kept her eyes on him, and they told him
      that she meant himself. He chilled, as though ether were being poured
      through his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did the world know, then, that Charley Steele was alive? Was the law
      sending its officers to seize the embezzler, the ruffian who had robbed
      widow and orphan?
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were so.... To go back to the world whence he came, with the injury
      he must do to others, and the punishment also that he must suffer, if he
      did not tell the truth about Billy! And Chaudiere, which, in spite of all,
      was beginning to have a real belief in him&mdash;where was his contempt
      for the world now!... And Rosalie, who trusted him&mdash;this new element
      rapidly grew dominant in his thoughts-to be the common criminal in her
      eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      His paleness gave way to a flush as like her own as could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean me?" he asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had thought that his flush meant anger, and she was surprised at the
      quiet tone. She nodded assent. "For what crime?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For stealing."
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart seemed to stand still. Then, it had come in spite of all it had
      come. Here was his resurrection, and the old life to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did I steal?" he asked with dull apathy. "The gold vessels from the
      Catholic Cathedral of Quebec, after&mdash;after trying to blow up
      Government House with gunpowder."
    </p>
    <p>
      His despair passed. His face suddenly lighted. He smiled. It was so
      absurd. "Really!" he said. "When was the place blown up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two days before you came here last year&mdash;it was not blown up; an
      attempt was made."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I did not know. Why was the attempt made to blow it up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some Frenchman's hatred of the English, they say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I am not French."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They do not know. You speak French as perfectly as English&mdash;ah,
      Monsieur, Monsieur, I believe you are whatever you say." Pain and appeal
      rang from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am only an honest tailor," he answered gently. He ruled his face to
      calmness, for he read the agony in the girl's face, and troubled as he
      was, he wished to show her that he had no fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is for what you were they will arrest you," she said helplessly, and
      as though he needed to have all made clear to him. "Oh, Monsieur," she
      continued, in a broken voice, "it would shame me so to have you made a
      prisoner in Chaudiere&mdash;before all these silly people, who turn with
      the wind. I should not lift my head&mdash;but yes, I should lift my head!"
      she added hurriedly. "I should tell them all they lied&mdash;every one&mdash;the
      idiots! The Seigneur&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what of the Seigneur-Rosalie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own name on his lips&mdash;the sound of it dimmed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Rossignol does not know you. He neither believes nor
      disbelieves. He said to me that if you wanted consideration, to command
      him, for in Chaudiere he had heard nothing but good of you. If you stayed,
      he would see that you had justice&mdash;not persecution. I saw him two
      hours ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      She said the last words shyly, for she was thinking why the Seigneur had
      spoken as he did&mdash;that he had taken her opinion of Monsieur as his
      guide, and she had not scrupled to impress him with her views. The
      Seigneur was in danger of becoming prejudiced by his sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wave of feeling passed over Charley, a rushing wave of sympathy for this
      simple girl, who, out of a blind confidence, risked so much for him. Risk
      there certainly was, if she&mdash;if she cared for him. It was cruelty not
      to reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Touching his breast, he said gravely: "By this sign here, I am not guilty
      of the crime for which they come to seek me, Rosalie. Nor of any other
      crime for which the law might punish me&mdash;dear, noble friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so little to get such rich return. Her eyes leaped up to brighter
      degrees of light, her face shone with a joy it had never reflected before,
      her blood rushed to her finger-tips. She abruptly sat down in a chair and
      buried her face in her hands, trembling. Then, lifting her head slowly,
      after a moment she spoke in a tone that told him her faith, her gratitude&mdash;not
      for reassurance, but for confidence, which is as water in a thirsty land
      to a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Monsieur, I thank you, I thank you from the depth of my heart; and my
      heart is deep indeed, very, very deep&mdash;I cannot find what lies lowest
      in it! I thank you, because you trust me, because you make it so easy to&mdash;to
      be your friend; to say 'I know' when any one might doubt you. One has no
      right to speak for another till&mdash;till the other has given confidence,
      has said you may. Ah, Monsieur, I am so happy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In very abandonment of heart she clasped her hands and came a step nearer
      to him, but abruptly stopped still; for, realising her action, timidity
      and embarrassment rushed upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley understood, and again his impulse was to say what was in his heart
      and dare all; but resolution possessed him, and he said quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once, Rosalie, you saved me&mdash;from death perhaps. Once your hands
      helped my pain&mdash;here." He touched his breast. "Your words now, and
      what you do, they still help me&mdash;here... but in a different way. The
      trouble is in my heart, Rosalie. You are glad of my confidence? Well, I
      will give you more.... I cannot go back to my old life. To do so would
      injure others&mdash;some who have never injured me and some who have. That
      is why. That is why I do not wish to be taken to Quebec now on a false
      charge. That is all I can say. Is it enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was about to answer, but Jo Portugais entered, exclaiming. "M'sieu',"
      he cried, "men are coming with the Seigneur and Cure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley nodded at Jo, then turned to Rosalie. "You need not be seen if you
      go out by the back way, Mademoiselle." He held aside the bear-skin curtain
      of the door that led into the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a frightened look in her face. "Do not fear for me," he
      continued. "It will come right&mdash;somehow. You have done more for me
      than any one has ever done or ever will do. I will remember till the last
      moment of my life. Good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid a hand on her shoulder and gently pushed her from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God protect you! The Blessed Virgin speak for you! I will pray for you,"
      she whispered.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. CHARLEY STANDS AT BAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Charley turned quickly to the woodsman. "Listen," he said, and he told Jo
      how things stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not hide, M'sieu'? There is time," Jo asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not hide, Jo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll decide when they come."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, then the sound of voices on the hill-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley's soul rose up in revolt against the danger that faced him&mdash;not
      against personal peril, but the danger of being dragged back again into
      the life he had come from, with all that it involved&mdash;the futility of
      this charge against him! To be the victim of an error&mdash;to go to the
      bar of justice with the hand of injustice on his arm!
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once the love of this new life welled up in him, as a spring of
      water overflows its bounds. A voice kept ringing in his ears, "I will pray
      for you." Subconsciously his mind kept saying, "Rosalie&mdash;Rosalie&mdash;Rosalie!"
      There was nothing now that he would not do to avert his being taken away
      upon this ridiculous charge. Mistaken identity? To prove that, he must at
      once prove himself&mdash;who he was, whence he came. Tell the Cure, and
      make it a point of honour for his secret to be kept? But once told, the
      new life would no longer stand by itself as the new life, cut off from all
      contact with the past. Its success, its possibility, must lie in its
      absolute separateness, with obscurity behind&mdash;as though he had come
      out of nothing into this very room, on that winter morning when memory
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that he must, somehow, evade the issue. He glanced at Jo,
      whose eyes, strained and painful, were fixed upon the door. Here was a man
      who suffered for his sake.... He took a step forward, as though with
      sudden resolve, but there came a knocking, and, pausing, he motioned Jo to
      open the door. Then, turning to a shelf, he took something from it
      hastily, and kept it in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo roused himself with an effort, and opened to the knocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three people entered: the Seigneur, the Cure, and the Abbe Rossignol, an
      ascetic, severe man, with a face of intolerance and inflexibility. Two
      constables in plain clothes followed; one stolid, one alert, one English
      and one French, both with grim satisfaction in their faces&mdash;the
      successful exercise of his trade is pleasant to every craftsman. When they
      entered, Charley was standing with his back to the fireplace, his
      eye-glass adjusted, one hand stroking his beard, the other held behind his
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure came forward and shook hands in an eager friendly way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Monsieur," said he, "I hope that you are better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite well, thank you, Monsieur le Cure," answered Charley. "I shall
      get back to work on Monday, I hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, that is good," responded the Cure, and seemed confused. He
      turned uneasily to the Seigneur. "You have come to see my friend
      Portugais," Charley remarked slowly, almost apologetically. "I will take
      my leave." He made a step forward. The two constables did the same, and
      would have laid their hands upon his shoulder but that the Seigneur said
      tartly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand off, Jack-in-boxes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The two stood aside, and looked covertly at the Seigneur, whose temper
      seemed unusually irascible. Charley's face showed no surprise, but he
      looked inquiringly at the Cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they wish to be measured for uniforms&mdash;or manners&mdash;I will
      see them at my shop," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur chuckled. Charley stepped again towards the door. The two
      constables stood before it. Again he turned inquiringly, this time towards
      the Cure. The Cure did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is you we wish to see, tailor," said the Abbe Rossignol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soft-tongued irony leaped to Charley's lips: "Have I, then, the honour of
      including Monsieur among my customers? I cannot recall Monsieur's figure.
      I think I should not have forgotten it."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now the old Charley Steele, with the new body, the new spirit, but
      with the old skilful mind, aggravatingly polite, non-intime&mdash;the
      intolerant face of this father of souls irritated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never forget a figure which has idiosyncrasy," he added, with a bland
      eye wandering over the priest's gaunt form. It was his old way to strike
      first and heal after&mdash;"a kick and a lick," as old Paddy Wier, whom he
      once saved from prison, said of him. It was like bygone years of another
      life to appear in defence when the law was tightening round a victim. The
      secret spring had been touched, the ancient machinery of his mind was
      working almost automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illusion was considerable, for the Seigneur had taken the only
      arm-chair in the room, a little apart, as it were, filling the place of
      judge. The priest-brother, cold and inveterate, was like the attorney for
      the crown. The Cure was the clerk of the court, who could only echo the
      decisions of the Judge. The constables were the machinery of the Law, and
      Jo Portugais was the unwilling witness, whose evidence would be the crux
      of the case. The prisoner&mdash;he himself was prisoner and prisoner's
      counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good struggle was forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had enraged the Abbe as much as he had delighted the Abbe's brother;
      for nothing gave the Seigneur such pleasure as the discomfiture of the
      Abbe Rossignol, chaplain and ordinary to the Archbishop of Quebec. The
      genial, sympathetic nature of the Seigneur could not even be patient with
      the excessive piety of the churchman, who, in rigid righteousness, had
      thrashed him cruelly as a boy. At Charley's words upon the Abbe's figure,
      gaunt and precise as a swaddled ramrod, he pulled his nose with a grunt of
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure, the peace-maker, intervened. The tailor's meaning was
      sufficiently clear: if they had come to see him personally, then it was
      natural for him to wish to know the names and stations of his guests, and
      their business. The Seigneur was aware that the tailor did know, and he
      enjoyed the 'sang-froid' with which he was meeting the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," said the Cure, in a mollifying voice, "I have ventured to
      bring the Seigneur of Chaudiere"&mdash;the Seigneur stood up and bowed
      gravely&mdash;"and his brother, the Abbe Rossignol, who would speak with
      you on private business"&mdash;he ignored the presence of the constables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley bowed to the Seigneur and the Abbe, then turned inquiringly
      towards the two constables. "Friends of my brother the Abbe," said the
      Seigneur maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their names, Monsieur?" asked Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have numbers," answered the Seigneur whimsically&mdash;to the Cure's
      pain, for levity seemed improper at such a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Numbers of names are legally suspicious, numbers for names are
      suspiciously legal," rejoined Charley. "You have pierced the disguise of
      discourtesy," said the Seigneur, and, on the instant, he made up his mind
      that whatever the tailor might have been, he was deserving of respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have private business with me, Monsieur?" asked Charley of the Abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe shook his head. "The business is not private, in one sense. These
      men have come to charge you with having broken into the cathedral at
      Quebec and stolen the gold vessels of the altar; also with having tried to
      blow up the Governor's residence."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the constables handed Charley the warrant. He looked at it with a
      curious smile. It was so natural, yet so unnatural, to be thus in touch
      with the habits of far-off times.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On what information is this warrant issued?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is for the law to show in due course," said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me; it is for the law to show now. I have a right to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      The constables shifted from one foot to the other, looked at each other
      meaningly, and instinctively felt their weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe," said the Seigneur evenly, "that&mdash;" The Abbe interrupted.
      "He can have information at his trial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, but the warrant has my endorsement," said the Seigneur, "and,
      as the justice most concerned, I shall give proper information to the
      gentleman under suspicion." He waved a hand at the Abbe, as at a fractious
      child, and turned courteously to Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," he said, "on the tenth of August last the cathedral at Quebec
      was broken into, and the gold altar-vessels were stolen. You are
      suspected. The same day an attempt was made to blow up the Governor's
      residence. You are suspected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On what ground, Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You appeared in this vicinity three days afterwards with an injury to the
      head. Now, the incendiary received a severe blow on the head from a
      servant of the Governor. You see the connection, Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the servant of the Governor, Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead, unfortunately. He told the story so often, to so much hospitality,
      that he lost his footing on Mountain Street steps&mdash;you remember
      Mountain Street steps possibly, Monsieur?&mdash;and cracked his head on
      the last stone."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment. If the thing had not been so serious,
      Charley must have laughed outright. If he but disclosed his identity, how
      easy to dispose of this silly charge! He did not reply at once, but looked
      calmly at the Abbe. In the pause, the Seigneur added "I forgot to add that
      the man had a brown beard. You have a brown beard, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had not when I arrived here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo Portugais spoke. "That is true, M'sieu'; and what is more, I know a
      newly shaved face when I see it, and M'sieu's was tanned with the sun. It
      is foolish, that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is not the place for evidence," said the Abbe sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, Abbe," said his brother; "if Monsieur wishes to have a
      preliminary trial here, he may. He is in my seigneury; he is a tenant of
      the Church here&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a grave offence that an infidel, dropping down here from, who knows
      where&mdash;that an acknowledged infidel should be a tenant of the
      Church!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil is a tenant of the Almighty, if creation is the Almighty's,"
      said Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Satan is a prisoner," snapped the Abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With large domains for exercise," retorted Charley, "and in successful
      opposition to the Church. If it is true that the man you charge is an
      infidel, how does that warrant suspicion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Other thefts," answered the Abbe. "A sacred iron cross was stolen from
      the door of the church of Chaudiere. I have no doubt that the thief of the
      gold vessels of the cathedral was the thief of the iron cross."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not true," sullenly broke in Jo Portugais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What proof have you?" said the Seigneur. Charley waved a deprecating hand
      towards Jo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not call Portugais as evidence," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are conducting your own case?" asked the Seigneur, with a grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is dangerous, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will take my chances," answered Charley. "Will you tell me what object
      the criminal could have in stealing the gold vessels from the cathedral?"
      he added, turning to the Abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were gold!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for taking the cross from the door of the church in Chaudiere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was sacred, and he was an infidel, and hated it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not see the logic of the argument. He stole the vessels because they
      were valuable, and the iron cross because he was an infidel! Now how do
      you know that the suspected criminal was an infidel, Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well known."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he ever said so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does not deny it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were charged with being an opium-eater, does it follow that you
      are one because you do not deny it? There was a Man who was said to
      blaspheme, to have all 'the crafts and assaults of the devil'&mdash;was it
      His duty to deny it? Suppose you were accused of being a highwayman, would
      you be less a highwayman if you denied it? Or would you be less guilty if
      you denied it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is beside the case," said the priest with acerbity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, I think it is the case itself," said the Seigneur with a satisfied
      pull of his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But do you seriously suggest that only infidels rob churches?" Charley
      persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not here to be cross-examined," answered the Abbe harshly. "You are
      charged with robbing the cathedral and trying to blow up the Governor's
      residence. Arrest him!" he added, turning to the constables.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand where you are, men," sharply threatened the Seigneur. "There are no
      lettres de cachet nowadays, Francois," he added tartly to his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it is the exclusive temptation of an infidel to rob a church, has
      infidelity also an inherent penchant for arson? Is it a patent? Why did
      the infidel blow up the Governor's residence?" continued Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did not blow it up, he only tried," interposed the Cure softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not aware," said Charley. "Well, did the man who stole the patens
      from the altar&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were chalices," again interrupted the Cure, with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I was not aware!" again rejoined Charley. "I repeat, what reason had
      the person who stole the chalices to try to blow up the Governor's
      residence? Is it a sign of infidelity, or&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can answer for that yourself," angrily interposed the Abbe. The
      strain was telling on his nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is fair to give reasons for the suspicion," urged the Seigneur acidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I said before, Francois, this is not the fifteenth century."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hated the English government," said the Abbe. "I do not understand,"
      responded Charley. "Am I then to suppose that the alleged criminal was a
      Frenchman as well as an infidel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence, and Charley continued. "It is an unusual thing for a
      French Abbe to be so concerned for the safety of an English Protestant's
      life and housing... the Governor is a Protestant&mdash;eh? That is,
      indeed, a zeal almost Christian&mdash;or millennial."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abby turned to the Seigneur. "Are you going to interfere longer with
      the process of the law?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Monsieur has not quite finished his argument," said the Seigneur,
      with a twist of the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the man was a Frenchman, why do you suspect the tailor of Chaudiere?"
      asked Charley softly. "Of course I understand the reason behind all: you
      have heard that the tailor is an infidel; you have protested to the good
      Cure here, and the Cure is a man who has a sense of justice, and will not
      drive a poor man from his parish by Christian persecution&mdash;without
      cause. Since certain dates coincide and impulses urge, you suspect the
      tailor. Again, according to your mind, a man who steals holy vessels must
      needs be an infidel; therefore a tailor in Chaudiere, suspected of being
      an infidel, stole the holy chalices. It might seem a fair case for a grand
      jury of clericals. But it breaks down in certain places. Your criminal is
      a Frenchman; the tailor of Chaudiere is an Englishman."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe's face was contracted with stubborn annoyance, though he held his
      tongue from violence. "Do you deny that you are French?" he asked tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could almost endure the suspicion because of the compliment to my
      command of your charming language."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prove that you are an Englishman. No one knows where you came from; no
      one knows what you are. You are a fair subject for suspicion, apart from
      the evidence shown," said the Abbe, trying now to be as polite as the
      tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a free country. So long as the law is obeyed, one can go where
      one wills without question, I take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a law of vagrancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a householder, a tenant of the Church, not a vagrant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, you can have your choice of proving these things here or in
      Quebec," said the Abbe, with angry impatience again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may not be compelled to prove anything. It is the privilege of the law
      to prove the crime against me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a very remarkable tailor," said the Abbe sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not had the honour of making you even a cassock, I think. Monsieur
      le Cure, I believe, approves of those I make for him. He has a good
      figure, however."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You refuse to identify yourself?" asked the Abbe, with asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not aware that you possess any right to ask me to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe's thin lips clipped-to like shears. He turned again towards the
      officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would relieve the situation," interposed the Seigneur, "if Monsieur
      could find it possible to grant the Abbe's demand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley bowed to the Seigneur. "I do not know why I should be taken for a
      Frenchman or an infidel. I speak French well, I presume, but I spoke it
      from the cradle. I speak English with equally good accent," he added, with
      the glimmer of a smile; for there was a kind of exhilaration in the little
      contest, even with so much at stake. This miserable, silly charge had that
      behind it which might open up a grave, make its dead to walk, fright folk
      from their senses, and destroy their peace for ever. Yet he was cool and
      thinking clearly. He measured up the Abbe in his mind, analysed him, found
      the vulnerable spot in his nature, the avenue to the one place lighted by
      a lamp of humanity. He leaned a hand upon the ledge of the chimney where
      he stood, and said, in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur l'Abbe, it is sometimes the misfortune of just men to be
      terribly unjust. 'For conscience sake' is another name for prejudice&mdash;for
      those antipathies which, natural to us, are, at the same time, trap-doors,
      for our just intentions. You, Monsieur, have a radical antipathy to those
      men who are unable to see or to feel what you were privileged to see and
      feel from the time of your birth. You know that you are right. Do you
      think that those who do not see as you do are wicked because they were not
      given what you were given? If you are right, may they, poor folk! not be
      the victims of their blindness of heart&mdash;of the darkness born with
      them, or of the evils that overtake them? For conscience sake, you would
      crush out evil. To you an infidel&mdash;so called&mdash;is an evil-doer, a
      peril to the peace of God. You drive him out from among the faithful. You
      heard that a tailor of Chaudiere was an infidel. You did not prove him
      one, but you, for conscience sake, are trying to remove him, by fixing on
      him a crime of which he may, with slight show of reason, be suspected. But
      I ask you, would you have taken the same deep interest in setting the law
      upon this suspected man did you not believe him to be an infidel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused. The Abbe made no reply. The Cure was bending forward eagerly;
      the Seigneur sat with his hands over the top of his cane, his chin on his
      hands, never taking his eyes from him, save to glance once or twice at his
      brother. Jo Portugais was crouched on the bench, watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know what makes an infidel," Charley went on. "Is it an honest
      mind, a decent life, an austerity of living as great as that of any
      priest, a neighbourliness that gives and takes in fairness&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, no," interposed the Cure eagerly. "So you have lived here,
      Monsieur; I can vouch for that. Charity and a good heart have gone with
      you always."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that a man is an infidel because he cannot say, as Louis
      Trudel said to me, 'Do you believe in God?' and replies, as I replied,
      'God knows!' Is that infidelity? If God is God, He alone knows when the
      mind or the tongue can answer in the terms of that faith which you
      profess. He knows the secret desires of our hearts, and what we believe,
      and what we do not believe; He knows better than we ourselves know&mdash;if
      there is a God. Does a man conjure God, if he does not believe in God?
      'God knows!' is not a statement of infidelity. With me it was a phrase&mdash;no
      more. You ask me to bare my inmost soul. I have not learned how to
      confess. You ask me to lay bare my past, to prove my identity. For
      conscience sake you ask that, and I for conscience sake say I will not,
      Monsieur. You, when you enter your priestly life, put all your past behind
      you. It is dead for ever: all its deeds and thoughts and desires, all its
      errors&mdash;sins. I have entered on a life here which is to me as much a
      new life as your priesthood is to you. Shall I not have the right to say,
      that may not be disinterred? Have I not the right to say, Hands off? For
      the past I am responsible, and for the past I will speak from the past;
      but for the deeds of the present I will speak only from the present. I am
      not a Frenchman; I did not steal the little cross from the church door
      here, nor the golden chalices in Quebec; nor did I seek to injure the
      Governor's residence. I have not been in Quebec for three years."
    </p>
    <p>
      He ceased speaking, and fixed his eyes on the Abbe, who now met his look
      fairly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the way of justice, there is nothing hidden that shall not be
      revealed, nor secret that shall not be made known," answered the Abbe.
      "Prove that you were not in Quebec on the day the robbery was committed."
      There was silence. The Abbe's pertinacity was too difficult. The Seigneur
      saw the grim look in Charley's face, and touched the Abbe on the arm. "Let
      us walk a little outside. Come, Cure" he added. "It is right that Monsieur
      should have a few minutes alone. It is a serious charge against him, and
      reflection will be good for us all."
    </p>
    <p>
      He motioned the constables from the room. The Abby passed through the door
      into the open air, and the Cure and the Seigneur went arm in arm together,
      talking earnestly. The Cure turned in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Courage, Monsieur!" he said to Charley, and bowed himself out. Jo
      Portugais followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One officer took his place at the front door and the other at the back
      door, outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abby, by himself, took to walking backward and forward under the
      trees, buried in gloomy reflection. Jo Portugais caught his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come with me for a moment, M'sieu'," he said. "It is important."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abby followed him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. JO PORTUGAIS TELLS A STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jo Portugais had fastened down a secret with clasps heavier than iron, and
      had long stood guard over it. But life is a wheel, and natures move in
      circles, passing the same points again and again, the points being distant
      or near to the sense as the courses of life have influenced the nature.
      Confession was an old principle, a light in the way, a rest-house for Jo
      and all his race, by inheritance, by disposition, and by practice. Again
      and again Jo had come round to the rest-house since one direful day, but
      had not, found his way therein. There were passwords to give at the door,
      there was the tale of the journey to tell to the door-keeper. And this
      tale he had not been ready to tell. But the man who knew of the terrible
      thing he had done, who had saved him from the consequences of that
      terrible thing, was in sore trouble, and this broke down the gloomy guard
      he had kept over his dread secret. He fought the matter out with himself,
      and, the battle ended, he touched the door-keeper on the arm, beckoned him
      to a lonely place in the trees, and knelt down before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it you seek?" asked the door-keeper, whose face was set and
      forbidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To find peace," answered the man; yet he was thinking more of another's
      peril than of his own soul. "What have I to do with the peace of your
      soul? Yonder is your shepherd and keeper," said the doorkeeper, pointing
      to where two men walked arm in arm under the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall the sinner not choose the keeper of his sins?" said the man
      huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who has been the keeper all these years? Who has given you peace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have had no keeper; I have had no peace these many years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many years?" The Abbe's voice was low and even, and showed no
      feeling, but his eyes were keenly inquiring and intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seven years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the sin that held you back from the comfort of the Church a great
      one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The greatest, save one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would be the greatest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To curse God."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To murder."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other's whole manner changed on the instant. He was no longer the
      stern Churchman, the inveterate friend of Justice, the prejudiced priest,
      rigid in a pious convention, who could neither bend nor break. The sin of
      an infidel breaker of the law, that was one thing; the crime of a son of
      the Church, which a human soul came to relate in its agony, that was
      another. He had a crass sense of justice, but there was in him a deeper
      thing still: the revelation of the human soul, the responsibility of
      speaking to the heart which has dropped the folds of secrecy, exposing the
      skeleton of truth, grim and staring, to the eye of a secret earthly
      mentor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it has been hidden all these years, why do you tell it now, my son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the only way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why was it hidden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come to confess," answered the man bitterly. The priest looked at
      him anxiously. "You have spoken rightly, my son. I am not here to ask, but
      to receive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, but it is my crime I would speak of now. I choose this moment
      that another should not suffer for what he did not do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest thought of the man they had left in the little house, and the
      crime with which he was charged, and wondered what the sinner before him
      was going to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell your story, my son, and God give your tongue the very spirit of
      truth, that nothing be forgotten and nothing excused."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fleeting pause, in which the colour left the priest's face,
      and, as he opened the door of his mind&mdash;of the Church, secret and
      inviolate&mdash;he had a pain at his heart; for beneath his arrogant
      churchmanship there was a fanatical spirituality of a mediaeval kind. His
      sense of responsibility was painful and intense. The same pain possessed
      him always, were the sin that of a child or a Borgia.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he listened to the broken tale, the forest around was vocal, the
      chipmunks scampered from tree to tree, the woodpecker's tap-tap, tap-tap,
      went on over their heads, the leaves rustled and gave forth their divine
      sweetness, as though man and nature were at peace, and there were no
      storms in sky above or soul beneath, or in the waters of life that are
      deeper than "the waters under the earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a short time, but to the door-keeper and the wayfarer it
      seemed hours, for the human soul travels far and hard and long in moments
      of pain and revelation. The priest in his anxiety suffered as much as the
      man who did the wicked thing. When the man had finished, the priest said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the great sin of my life." He shuddered, and continued: "I have no
      love of life; I have no fear of death; but there is the man who saved me
      years ago, who got me freedom. He has had great sorrow and trouble, and I
      would live for his sake&mdash;because he has no friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is the man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other pointed to where the little house was hidden among the trees.
      The priest almost gasped his amazement, but waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the woodsman told the whole truth concerning the tailor of
      Chaudiere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To save him, I have confessed my own sin. To you I might tell all in
      confession, and the truth about him would be buried for ever. I might not
      confess at all unless I confessed my own sin. You will save him, father?"
      he asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will save him," was the reply of the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to give myself to justice; but he has been ill, and he may be ill
      again, and he needs me." He told of the tailor's besetting weakness, of
      his struggles against it, of his fall a few days before, and the cause of
      it... told all to the man of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish to give yourself to justice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have no peace unless."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something martyr-like in the man's attitude. It appealed to some
      stern, martyr-like quality in the priest. If the man would win eternal
      peace so, then so be it. His grim piety approved. He spoke now with the
      authority of divine justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For one year longer go on as you are, then give yourself to justice&mdash;one
      year from to-day, my son. Is it enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolvo te!" said the priest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. THE EDGE OF LIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meantime Charley was alone with his problem. The net of circumstances
      seemed to have coiled inextricably round him. Once, at a trial in court in
      other days, he had said in his ironical way: "One hasn't to fear the
      penalties of one's sins, but the damnable accident of discovery."
    </p>
    <p>
      To try to escape now, or, with the assistance of Jo Portugais, when en
      route to Quebec in charge of the constables, and find refuge and seclusion
      elsewhere? There was nothing he might ask of Portugais which he would not
      do. To escape&mdash;and so acknowledge a guilt not his own! Well, what did
      it matter! Who mattered? He knew only too well. The Cure mattered&mdash;that
      good man who had never intruded his piety on him; who had been from the
      first a discreet friend, a gentleman,&mdash;a Christian gentleman, if
      there was such a sort of gentleman apart from all others. Who mattered?
      The Seigneur, whom he had never seen before, yet who had showed that day a
      brusque sympathy, a gruff belief in him? Who mattered?
    </p>
    <p>
      Above all, Rosalie mattered. To escape, to go from Rosalie's presence by a
      dark way, as it were, like a thief in the night&mdash;was that possible?
      His escape would work upon her mind. She would first wonder, then doubt,
      and then believe at last that he was a common criminal. She was the one
      who mattered in that thought of escape escape to some other parish, to
      some other province, to some other country&mdash;to some other world!
    </p>
    <p>
      To some other world? He looked at a little bottle he held in the palm of
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand held aside the curtain of the door entering on the next room, and a
      girl's troubled face looked in, but he did not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Escape to some other world? And why not, after all? On the day his memory
      came back he had resisted the idea in this very room. As the fatalist he
      had resisted it then. Now how poor seemed the reasons for not having ended
      it all that day! If his appointed time had been come, the river would have
      ended him then&mdash;that had been his argument. Was that argument not
      belief in Somebody or Something which governed his going or staying? Was
      it not preordination? Was not fatalism, then, the cheapest sort of belief
      in an unchangeable Somebody or Something, representing purpose and law and
      will? Attribute to anything power, and there was God, whatever His
      qualities, personality, or being.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little phial of laudanum was in his hand to loosen life into
      knowledge. Was it not his duty to eliminate himself, rather than be an
      unsolvable quantity in the problem of many lives? It was neither vulgar
      nor cowardly to pass quietly from forces making for ruin, and so avert
      ruin and secure happiness. To go while yet there was time, and smooth for
      ever the way for others by an eternal silence&mdash;that seemed well.
      Punishment thereafter, the Cure would say. But was it not worth while
      being punished, even should the Cure's fond belief in the noble fable be
      true, if one saved others here? Who&mdash;God or man&mdash;had the right
      to take from him the right to destroy himself, not for fear, not through
      despair, but for others' sake? Had he not the right to make restitution to
      Kathleen for having given her nothing but himself, whom she had learned to
      despise? If he were God, he would say, Do justice and fear not. And this
      was justice. Suppose he were in a battle, with all these things behind
      him, and put himself, with daring and great results, in some forlorn hope&mdash;to
      die; and he died, ostensibly a hero for his country, but, in his heart of
      hearts, to throw his life away to save some one he loved, not his country,
      which profited by his sacrifice&mdash;suppose that were the case, what
      would the world say?
    </p>
    <p>
      "He saved others, himself he could not save"&mdash;flashed through his
      mind, possessed him. He could save others; but it was clear he could not
      save himself. It was so simple, so kind, and so decent. And he would be
      buried here in quiet, unconsecrated ground, a mystery, a tailor who,
      finding he could not mend the garment of life, cast it away, and took on
      himself the mantle of eternal obscurity. No reproaches would follow him;
      and he would not reproach himself, for Kathleen and Billy and another
      would be safe and free to live their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far, far better for Rosalie! She too would be saved&mdash;free from the
      peril of his presence. For where could happiness come to her from him? He
      might not love her; he might not marry her; and it were well to go now,
      while yet love was not a habit, but an awakening, a realisation of life.
      His death would settle this sad question for ever. To her he would be a
      softening memory as time went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl who had watched by the curtain stepped softly inside the room ...
      she divined his purpose. He was so intent he did not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do it," he said to himself. "It is better to go than to stay. I
      have never done a good thing for love of any human being. I will do one
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned towards the window through which the sunlight streamed. Stepping
      forward into the sun, he uncorked the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a quick step behind him, and the girl's voice said clearly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you go, I go also."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned swiftly, cold with amazement, the blood emptied from his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie stood a little distance from him, her face pale, her hands held
      hard to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand all. I could not go outside, I stayed there"&mdash;she
      pointed to the other room&mdash;"and I know why you would die. You would
      die to save others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie!" he protested in a hoarse voice, and could say nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think that I will stay, if you go! No, no, no&mdash;I will not. You
      taught me how to live, and I will follow you now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the strange determination of her look. It startled him; he knew not
      what to say. "Your father, Rosalie&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father will be cared for. But who will care for you in the place where
      you are going? You will have no friends there. You shall not go alone. You
      will need me&mdash;in the dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is good that I go," he said. "It would be wicked, it would be
      dreadful, for you to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I go if you go," she urged. "I will lose my soul to be with you; you will
      want me&mdash;there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking her intention. Footsteps sounded outside. The
      others were coming back. To die here before her face? To bring her to
      death with him? He was sick with despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go into the next room quickly," he said. "No matter what comes, I will
      not&mdash;on my honour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw him a look of gratitude, and, as the bearskin curtain dropped
      behind her, he put the phial of laudanum in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and the Abbe Rossignol entered, followed by the Seigneur,
      the Cure, and Jo Portugais. Charley faced them calmly, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe's face was still cold and severe, but his voice was human as he
      said quickly: "Monsieur, I have decided to take you at your word. I am
      assured you are not the man who committed the crime. You probably have
      reasons for not establishing your identity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Charley been a prisoner in the dock, he could not have had a moment of
      deeper amazement&mdash;even if after the jury had said Guilty, a piece of
      evidence had been handed in, proving innocence, averting the death
      sentence. A wave of excitement passed over him, leaving him cold and
      still. In the other room a girl put her hand to her mouth to stifle a cry
      of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley bowed. "You made a mistake, Monsieur&mdash;pray do not apologise,"
      he said.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. IN AMBUSH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Weeks went by. Summer was done, autumn was upon the land. Harvest-home had
      gone, and the "fall" ploughing was forward. The smell of the burning
      stubble, of decaying plant and fibre, was mingling with the odours of the
      orchards and the balsams of the forest. The leafy hill-sides, far and
      near, were resplendent in scarlet and saffron and tawny red. Over the
      decline of the year flickered the ruined fires of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a prosperous summer in the valley. Harvests had been reaped
      such as the country had not known for years&mdash;and for years there had
      been great harvests. There had not been a death in the parish all summer,
      and births had occurred out of all usual proportion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Filion Lacasse commented thereon, and mentioned the fact that even
      the Notary's wife had had the gift of twins as the crowning fulness of the
      year, Maximilian Cour, who was essentially superstitious, tapped on the
      table three times, to prevent a turn in the luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baker was too late, however, for the very next day the Notary was
      brought home with a nasty gunshot wound in his leg. He had been lured into
      duck-hunting on a lake twenty miles away, in the hills, and had been
      accidentally shot on an Indian reservation, called Four Mountains, where
      the Church sometimes held a mission and presented a primitive sort of
      passion-play. From there he had been brought home by his comrades, and the
      doctor from the next parish summoned. The Cure assisted the doctor at
      first, but the task was difficult to him. At the instant when the case was
      most critical the tailor of Chaudiere set his foot inside the Notary's
      door. A moment later he relieved the Cure and helped to probe for shot,
      and care for an ugly wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley had no knowledge of surgery, but his fingers were skilful, his eye
      was true, and he had intuition. The long operation over, the rural
      physician and surgeon washed his hands and then studied Charley with
      curious admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Monsieur," he said, as he dried his hands on a towel. "I
      couldn't have done it without you. It's a pretty good job; and you share
      the credit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley bowed. "It's a good thing not to halloo till you're out of the
      woods," he said. "Our friend there has a bad time before him&mdash;hein?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take you. It is so." The man of knives and tinctures pulled his
      side-whiskers with smug satisfaction as he looked into a small mirror on
      the wall. "Do you chance to know if madame has any cordials or spirits?"
      he added, straightening his waistcoat and adjusting his cravat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is likely," answered Charley, and moved away to the window looking
      upon the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor turned in surprise. He was used to being waited on, and he had
      expected the tailor to follow the tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We might&mdash;eh?" he said suggestively. "It is usually the custom to
      provide refreshment, but the poor woman, madame, has been greatly occupied
      with her husband, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the twins," Charley put in drily&mdash;"and a house full of work, and
      only one old crone in the kitchen to help. Still, I have no doubt she has
      thought of the cordials too. Women are the slaves of custom&mdash;ah, here
      they are, as I said, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short, for in the doorway, with a tray, stood Rosalie
      Evanturel. The surgeon was so intent upon at once fortifying himself that
      he did not see the look which passed between Rosalie and the tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie had been absent for two months. Her father had been taken
      seriously ill the day after the critical episode in the but at Vadrome
      Mountain, and she had gone with him to the hospital at Quebec, for an
      operation. The Abbe Rossignol had undertaken to see them safely to the
      hospital, and Jo Portugais, at his own request, was permitted to go in
      attendance upon M. Evanturel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a hasty leave-taking between Charley and Rosalie, but it
      was in the presence of others, and they had never spoken a word privately
      together since the day she had said to him that where he went she would
      go, in life or out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been gone two months," Charley said now, after their touch of
      hands and voiceless greeting. "Two months yesterday," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At sundown," he replied, in an even voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Angelus was ringing," she answered calmly, though her heart was
      leaping and her hands were trembling. The doctor, instantly busy with the
      cordial, had not noticed what they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you join me?" he asked, offering a glass to Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spirits do not suit me," answered Charley. "Matter of constitution,"
      rejoined the doctor, and buttoned up his coat, preparing to depart. He
      came close to Charley. "Now, I don't want to put upon you, Monsieur," he
      said, "but this sick man is valuable in the parish&mdash;you take me?
      Well, it's a difficult, delicate case, and I'd be glad if I could rely on
      you for a few days. The Cure would do, but you are young, you have a sense
      of things&mdash;take me? Half the fees are yours if you'll keep a sharp
      eye on him&mdash;three times a day, and be with him at night a while.
      Fever is the thing I'm afraid of&mdash;temperature&mdash;this way,
      please!" He went to the window, and for a minute engaged Charley in
      whispered conversation. "You take me?" he said cheerily at last, as he
      turned again towards Rosalie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite, Monsieur," answered Charley, and drew away, for he caught the
      odour of the doctor's breath, and a cold perspiration broke out over him.
      He felt the old desire for drink sweeping through him. "I will do what I
      can," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, my dear," the doctor said to Rosalie. "We will go and see your
      father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley's eyes had fastened on the bottles avidly. As Rosalie turned to
      bid him good-bye, he said to her, almost hoarsely: "Take the tray back to
      Madame Dauphin&mdash;please."
    </p>
    <p>
      She flashed a glance of inquiry at him. She was puzzled by the fire in his
      eyes. With her soul in her face as she lifted the tray, out of the
      warm-beating life in her, she said in a low tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is good to live, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded and smiled, and the trouble slowly passed from his eyes. The
      woman in her had conquered his enemy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. THE COMING OF MAXIMILIAN COUR AND ANOTHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      "It is good to live, isn't it?" In the autumn weather when the air drank
      like wine, it seemed so indeed, even to Charley, who worked all day in his
      shop, his door wide open to the sunlight, and sat up half the night with
      Narcisse Dauphin, sometimes even taking a turn at the cradle of the twins,
      while madame sat beside her husband's bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Charley the answer to Rosalie's question lay in the fact that his eyes
      had never been so keen, his face so alive, or his step so buoyant as in
      this week of double duty. His mind was more hopeful than it had ever been
      since the day he awoke with memory restored in the silence of a mountain
      hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had found the antidote to his great temptation, to the lurking,
      relentless habit which had almost killed him the night John Brown had sung
      Champagne Charlie from behind the flaring lights. From a determination to
      fight his own fight with no material aids, he had never once used the
      antidote sent him by the Cure's brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      On St. Jean Baptiste's day his proud will had failed him; intellectual
      force, native power of mind, had broken like reeds under the weight of a
      cruel temptation. But now a new force had entered into him. As his fingers
      were about to reach for the spirit-bottle in the house of the Notary, and
      he had, for the first time in his life, made an appeal for help, a woman's
      voice had said, "It is good to live, isn't it?" and his hand was stayed. A
      woman's look had stilled the strife. Never before in his life had he
      relied on a moral or a spiritual impulse in him. What of these existed in
      him were in unseen quantities&mdash;for which there was neither multiple
      nor measure&mdash;had been primitive and hereditary, flowing in him like a
      feeble tincture diluted to inefficacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie had resolved him back to the original elements. The quiet days he
      had spent in Chaudiere, the self-sacrifice he had been compelled to make,
      the human sins, such as those of Jo Portugais and Louis Trudel, with which
      he had had to do, the simplicity of the life around him&mdash;the
      uncomplicated lie and the unvarnished truth, the obvious sorrow and the
      patent joy, the childish faith, and the rude wickedness so pardonable
      because so frankly brutal&mdash;had worked upon him. The elemental spirit
      of it all had so invaded his nature, breaking through the crust of old
      habit to the new man, that, when he fell before his temptation, and his
      body became saturated with liquor, the healthy natural being and the
      growing natural mind were overpowered by the coarse onslaught, and death
      had nearly followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his first appeal to a force outside himself, to an active principle
      unfamiliar to the voluntary working of his nature, and the answer had been
      immediate and adequate. Yet what was it? He did not ask; he had not got
      beyond the mere experience, and the old questioning habit was in abeyance.
      Each new and great emotion has its dominating moment, its supreme
      occasion, before taking its place in the modulated moral mechanism. He was
      touched with helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat beside Narcisse Dauphin's bedside, one evening, the sick man on
      his way to recovery, there came to him the text of a sermon he had once
      heard John Brown preach: "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man
      lay down his life for his friend." He had been thinking of Rosalie and
      that day at Vadrome Mountain. She would not only have died with him, but
      she would have died for him, if need had been. What might he give in
      return for what she gave?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Notary interrupted his thoughts. He had lain watching Charley for a
      long time, his brow drawn down with thought. At last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, you have been good to me." Charley laid a hand on the sick
      man's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see that. But if you won't talk, I'll believe you think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Notary shook his head. "I've not been talking for an hour, I've no
      fever, and I want to say some things. When I've said them, I'll feel
      better&mdash;voila! I want to make the amende honorable. I once thought
      you were this and that&mdash;I won't say what I thought you. I said you
      interfered&mdash;giving advice to people, as you did to Filion Lacasse,
      and taking the bread out of my mouth. I said that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, raised himself on his elbow, smoothed back his grizzled hair
      behind his ears, looked at himself in the mirror opposite with
      satisfaction, and added oracularly: "But how prone is the mind of man to
      judge amiss! You have put bread into my mouth&mdash;no, no, Monsieur, you
      shall hear me! As well as doing your own work, you have done my business
      since my accident as well as a lawyer could do it; and you've given every
      penny to my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for the work I've done," answered Charley, "it was nothing&mdash;you
      notaries have easy times. You may take your turn with my shears and needle
      one day."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a dash of patronage true to his nature, "You are wonderful for a
      tailor," the Notary rejoined. Charley laughed&mdash;seldom, if ever, had
      he laughed since coming to Chaudiere. It was, however, a curious fact that
      he took a real pleasure in the work he did with his hands. In making
      clothes for habitant farmers, and their sons and their sons' sons, and
      jackets for their wives and daughters, he had had the keenest pleasure of
      his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken his earnings with pride, if not with exultation. He knew the
      Notary did not mean that he was wonderful as a tailor, but he answered to
      the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You liked that last coat I made for you, then," he said drily; "I believe
      you wore it when you were shot. It was the thing for your figure, man."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Notary looked in the large mirror opposite with sad content. "Ah, it
      was a good figure, the first time I went to that hut at Four Mountains!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can't always be young. You have a waist yet, and your chest-barrel
      gives form to a waistcoat. Tut, tut! Think of the twins in the way of
      vainglory and hypocrisy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Twins' and 'hypocrisy'; there you have struck the nail on the head,
      tailor. There is the thing I'm going to tell you about."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a cautious glance at the door and the window, Dauphin continued in
      quick, broken sentences: "It wasn't an accident at Four Mountains&mdash;not
      quite. It was Paulette Dubois&mdash;you know the woman that lives at the
      Seigneur's gate? Twelve years ago she was a handsome girl. I fell in love
      with her, but she left here. There were two other men. There was a
      timber-merchant,&mdash;and there was a lawyer after. The timber-merchant
      was married; the lawyer wasn't. She lived at first with the
      timber-merchant. He was killed&mdash;murdered in the woods."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was the timber-merchant's name?" interrupted Charley in an even
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turley&mdash;but that doesn't matter!" continued the Notary. "He was
      murdered, and then the lawyer came on the scene. He lived with her for a
      year. She had a child by him. One day he sent the child away to a safe
      place and told her he was going to turn over a new leaf&mdash;he was going
      to stand for Parliament, and she must go. She wouldn't go without the
      child. At last he said the child was dead; and showed her the certificate
      of death. Then she came back here, and for a while, alas! she disgraced
      the parish. But all at once she changed&mdash;she got a message that her
      child was alive. To her it was like being born again. It was at this time
      they were going to drive her from the parish. But the Seigneur and then
      the Cure spoke for her, and so did I&mdash;at last."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused and plaintively admired himself in the mirror. He was grateful
      that he had been clean-shaved that morning, and he was content to catch
      the citrine odour of the bergamot upon his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      New phases of the most interesting case Charley had ever defended spread
      out before him&mdash;the case which had given him his friend Jo Portugais,
      which had turned his own destiny. Yet he could not quite trace in it the
      vital association of this vain Notary now in the confessional mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You behaved very well," said Charley tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you say that, knowing so little! What will you say when you know all&mdash;ah!
      That I should take a stand also was important. Neither the Seigneur nor
      the Cure was married; I was. I have been long-suffering for a cause. My
      marital felicity has been bruised&mdash;bruised&mdash;but not broken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are the twins," said Charley, with a half-closed eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could woman ask greater proof?" urged the Notary seriously, for the
      other's voice had been so well masked that he did not catch its satire.
      "But see my peril, and mark the ground of my interest in this poor wanton!
      Yet a woman&mdash;a woman-frail creatures, as we know, and to be pitied,
      not made more pitiable by the stronger sex.... But, see now! Why should I
      have perilled mine own conjugal peace, given ground for suspicion even&mdash;for
      I am unfortunate, unfortunate in the exterior with which Dame Nature has
      honoured me!" Again he looked in the mirror with sad complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these words his listener offered no comment, and he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "For this reason I lifted my voice for the poor wanton. It was I who wrote
      the letter to her that her child was alive. I did it with high purpose&mdash;I
      foresaw that she would change her ways if she thought her child was
      living. Was I mistaken? No. I am an observer of human nature. Intellect
      conquered. 'Io triumphe'. The poor fly-away changed, led a new life. Ever
      since then she has tried to get the man&mdash;the lawyer&mdash;to tell her
      where her child is. He has not done so. He has said the child is dead&mdash;always.
      When she seemed to give up belief, then would come another letter to her,
      telling her the child was living&mdash;but not where. So she would keep on
      writing to the man, and sometimes she would go away searching&mdash;searching.
      To what end? Nothing! She had a letter some months ago, for she had got
      restless, and a young kinsman of the Seigneur had come to visit at the
      seigneury for a week, and took much notice of her. There was danger.
      Voila, another letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, of course! Will you keep a secret&mdash;on your sacred honour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can keep a secret without sacred honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes, of course! You have a secret of your own&mdash;pardon me, I am
      only saying what every one says. Well, this is the secret of the woman
      Paulette Dubois. My cousin, Robespierre Dauphin, a notary in Quebec, is
      the agent of the lawyer, the father of the child. He pities the poor
      woman. But he is bound in professional honour to the lawyer fellow, not to
      betray. When visiting Robespierre once I found out the truth-by accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told him what I intended. He gave permission to tell the woman her
      child was alive; and, if need be for her good, to affirm it over and over
      again&mdash;no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this?" said Charley, pointing to the injured leg, for he now
      associated the accident with the secret just disclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you apprehend! You have an avocat's mind&mdash;almost. It was at Four
      Mountains. Paulette is superstitious; so not long ago she went to live
      there alone with an old half-breed woman who has second-sight. Monsieur,
      it is a gift unmistakably. For as soon as the hag clapped eyes on me in
      the hut, she said: 'There is the man that wrote you the letters.' Well&mdash;what!
      Paulette Dubois came down on me like an avalanche&mdash;Monsieur, like an
      avalanche! She believed the old witch; and there was I lying with an
      unconvincing manner"&mdash;he sighed&mdash;"lying requires practice, alas!
      She saw I was lying, and in a rage snatched up my gun. It went off by
      accident, and brought me down. Did she relent? Not so. She helped to bind
      me up, and the last words she said to me were: 'You will suffer; you will
      have time to think. I am glad. You have kept me on the rack. I shall only
      be sorry if you die, for then I shall not be able to torture you till you
      tell me where my child is!' Monsieur, I lied to the last, lest she should
      come here and make a noise; but I'm not sure it wouldn't have been better
      to break faith with Robespierre, and tell the poor wanton where her child
      is. What would you do, Monsieur? I cannot ask the Cure or the Seigneur&mdash;I
      have reasons. But you have the head of a lawyer&mdash;almost&mdash;and you
      have no local feelings, no personal interest&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should tell the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your reasons, Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because the lawyer is a scoundrel. Your betrayal of his secret is not a
      thousandth part so bad as one lie told to this woman, whose very life is
      her child. Is it a boy or a girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! What harm can be done? A left-handed boy is all right in the world.
      Your wife has twins&mdash;then think of the woman, the one ewe lamb of
      'the poor wanton.' If you do not tell her, you will have her here making a
      noise, as you say. I wonder she has not been here on your door-step."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had a letter from her to-day. She is coming-ah, mon dieu!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tap at the window. The Notary started. "Ah, Heaven, here she
      is!" he gasped, and drew over to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice came from outside. "Shall I play for you, Dauphin? It is as good
      as medicine."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Notary recovered himself at once. His volatile nature sprang back to
      its pose. He could forget Paulette Dubois for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Maximilian Cour in the garden," he said happily. Then he raised his
      voice. "Play on, baker; but something for convalescence&mdash;the return
      of spring, the sweet assonance of memory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A September air, and a gush of spring," said the baker, trying to crane
      his long neck through the window. "Ah, there you are, Dauphin! I shall
      give you a sleep to-night like a balmy eve." He nodded to the tailor.
      "M'sieu', you shall judge if sentiment be dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have racked my heart to play this time. I have called it, 'The Baffled
      Quest of Love'. I have taken the music of the song of Alsace, 'Le Jardin
      d'Amour', and I have made variations on it, keeping the last verse of the
      song in my mind. You know the song, M'sieu':
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "'Quand je vais au jardin, Jardin d'amour,
        Je crois entendu des pas,
        Je veux fuir, et n'ose pas.
        Voici la fin du jour...
        Je crains et j'hesite,
        Mon coeur bat plus vite
        En ce sejour...
        Quand je vais an jardin, jardin d'amour.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      The baker sat down on a stool he had brought, and began to tune his
      fiddle. From inside came the voice of the Notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Play 'The Woods are Green' first," he said. "Then the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Notary possessed the one high-walled garden in the village, and though
      folk gathered outside and said that the baker was playing for the sick
      man, there was no one in the garden save the fiddler himself. Once or
      twice a lad appeared on the top of the wall, looking over, but vanished at
      once when he saw Charley's face at the window. Long ere the baker had
      finished, the song was caught up from outside, and before the last notes
      of the violin had died away, twenty voices were singing it in the street,
      and forty feet marched away with it into the dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness comes quickly in this land of brief twilight. Presently out of
      the soft shadowed stillness, broken by the note of a vagrant whippoorwill,
      crept out from Maximilian Cour's old violin the music of 'The Baffled
      Quest of Love'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baker was not a great musician, but he had a talent, a rare gift of
      pathos, and an imagination untrammelled by rigorous rules of harmony and
      construction. Whatever there was in his sentimental bosom he poured into
      this one achievement of his life. It brought tears to the eyes of Narcisse
      Dauphin. It opened a gate of the garden wall, and drew inside a girl's
      face, shining with feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maximilian Cour spoke for more than himself that night. His philandering
      spirit had, at middle age, begotten a desire to house itself in a quiet
      place, where the blinds could be drawn close, and the room of life made
      ready with all the furniture of love. So he had spoken to his violin, and
      it had answered as it had never done before. The soul of the lean baker
      touched the heart of a man whose life had been but a baffled quest, and
      the spirit of a girl whose love was her sun by day, her moon by night, and
      the starlight of her dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the shade of the window the man the girl loved watched her as she
      sank upon the ground and clasped her hands before her in abandonment to
      the music. He watched her when the baker, at last, overcome by his own
      feelings&mdash;and ashamed of them&mdash;got up and stole swiftly out of
      the garden. He watched her till he saw her drop her face in her hands;
      then, opening the door and stealing out, he came and laid a hand upon her
      shoulder, and she heard him say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. BARRIERS SWEPT AWAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rosalie came to her feet, gasping with pleasure. She had been unhappy ever
      since she had returned from Quebec, for though she had sometimes been
      brought in contact with Charley in the Notary's house since the day of the
      operation, nothing had passed between them save the necessary commonplaces
      of a sick-room, given a little extra colour, perhaps, by the sense of
      responsibility which fell upon them both, and by that importance which
      hidden sentiment gives to every motion. The twins had been troublesome and
      ill, and Madame Dauphin had begged Rosalie to come in for a couple of
      hours every evening. Thus the tailor and the girl who, by every rule of
      wisdom, should have been kept as far apart as the poles, were played into
      each other's hands by human kindness and damnable propinquity. The man,
      manlike, felt no real danger, because nothing was said&mdash;after
      everything had been said for all time at the hut on Vadrome Mountain. He
      had not realised the true situation, because of late her voice, like his,
      had been even and her hand cool and steady. He had not noticed that her
      eyes were like hungry fires, eating up her face&mdash;eating away its
      roundness, and leaving a pathetic beauty behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him that because there was silence&mdash;neither the written
      word nor the speaking look&mdash;that all was well. He was hugging the
      chain of denial to his bosom, as though to say, "This way is safety"; he
      was hiding his face from the beacon-lights of her eyes, which said: "This
      way is home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Home? Pictures of home, of a home such as Maximilian Cour painted in his
      music, had passed before him now and then since that great day on Vadrome
      Mountain. A simple fireside, with frugal but comfortable fare; a few
      books; the study of the fields and woods; the daily humble task over which
      he could meditate as his hands worked mechanically; the happy face of a
      happy woman near&mdash;he had thought of home; and he had put it from him.
      No matter what the temptation, his must be, perhaps for ever, the bed and
      board unshared. He had had his chance in the old days, and he had thrown
      it away with insolent indifference, and an unpardonable contempt for the
      opinion of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, with a blind fatuousness which had nothing to do with his old
      intellectual power, but was evidence of a primitive life of feeling, had
      vaguely imagined that because there were no clinging hands, or stolen
      looks, or any vow or promise, that all might go on as at present&mdash;upon
      the surface. With a curious absence of his old accuracy of observation he
      was treating the immediate past&mdash;his and Rosalie's past&mdash;as if
      it did not actually exist; as if only the other and farther past was a
      tragedy, and this nearer one a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the film fell from his eyes as Maximilian Cour played his 'Baffled
      Quest', with its quaint, searching pathos; and as he saw the figure of the
      girl alone in the shade of the great rose-bushes, past and present became
      one, and the whole man was lost in that one word "Rosalie!" which called
      her to her feet with outstretched hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears sprang to her eyes; her face upturned to his was a mute appeal,
      a speechless 'Viens ici'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Past, present, future, duty, apprehension, consequences, suddenly fell
      away from Charley's mind like a garment slipping from the shoulders, and
      the new man, swept off his feet by the onrush of unused and ungoverned
      emotions, caught the girl to his arms with a desperate joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do you care, then&mdash;for me?" wept the girl, and hid her face in
      his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice came from inside the house: "Monsieur, Monsieur&mdash;ah, come, if
      you please, tailor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl drew back quickly, looked up at him for one instant with a
      triumphant happy daring, then, suddenly covered with confusion, turned,
      ran to the gate, opened it, passed swiftly out, and was swallowed up in
      the dusk.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. THE CHALLENGE OF PAULETTE DUBOIS
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, Monsieur!" came the voice from inside the house, querulously
      and anxiously. Charley entered the Notary's bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," said the Notary excitedly, "she is here&mdash;Paulette is
      here. My wife is asleep, thank God! but old Sophie has just told me that
      the woman asks to see me. Ah, Heaven above, what shall I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you leave it to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will do exactly as I say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, most sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Keep still. I will see her first. Trust to me." He turned and
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley found the woman in the Notary's office, which, while partly
      detached from the house, did duty as sitting-room and library. When
      Charley entered, the room was only lighted by two candles, and Paulette's
      face was hidden by a veil, but Charley observed the tremulousness of the
      figure and the nervous decision of manner. He had seen her before several
      times, and he had always noticed the air, half bravado, half shrinking,
      marking her walk and movements, as though two emotions were fighting in
      her. She was now dressed in black, save for one bright red ribbon round
      her throat, incongruous and garish.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw Charley she started, for she had expected the servant with a
      message from the Notary&mdash;her own message had been peremptory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to see the Notary," she said defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is not able to come to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you expect to go to his bedroom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" She was abrupt to discourtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are neither physician, nor relative."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have important business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I transact his business for him, Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a tailor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I learned that; I am learning to be a notary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My business is private."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I transact his private business too&mdash;that which his wife cannot do.
      Would you prefer his wife to me? It must be either the one or the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman started towards the door in a rage. He stepped between. "You
      cannot see the Notary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll see his wife, then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would only put the fat in the fire. His wife would not listen to
      you. She is quick-tempered, and she fancies she has reasons for not liking
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a fool. I haven't been always particular, but as for Narcisse
      Dauphin&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has been a good friend to you at some expense, the world says."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman struggled with herself. "The world lies!" she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he doesn't. The village was against you once. That was when the
      Notary, with the Seigneur, was for you&mdash;it has cost him something
      ever since, I'm told. You've never thanked him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has tortured me for years, the oily, smirking, lying&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has been your best friend," he interrupted. "Please sit down, and
      listen to me for a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, then did as he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He tells me that years ago he was in love with you. Hasn't he behaved
      better than some who said they loved you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman half started up, her eyes flashing, but met a deprecating motion
      of his hand and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He thought that if you knew your child lived, you would think better of
      life&mdash;and of yourself. He has his good points, the Notary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why doesn't he tell me where my child is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Notary is in bed&mdash;you shot him! Don't you think it is doing you
      a good turn not to have you arrested?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was an accident."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no, it wasn't! You couldn't make a jury believe that. And if you were
      in prison, how could you find your child? You see, you have treated the
      Notary very badly."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent, and he added, slowly: "He had good reasons for not telling
      you. It wasn't his own secret, and he hadn't come by it in a strictly
      professional way. Your child was being well cared for, and he told you
      simply that it was alive&mdash;for your own sake. But he has changed his
      mind at last, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman sprang from her seat. "He will tell me&mdash;he will tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur-Monsieur&mdash;ah, my God, but you are kind! How should you know&mdash;what
      do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you my word that by to-morrow evening you shall know where your
      child is."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she was bewildered and overcome, then a look of gratitude, of
      luminous hope, covered her face, softening the hardness of its contour,
      and she fell on her knees beside the table, dropped her head in her arms,
      and sobbed as if her heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My little lamb, my little, little lamb-my own dearest!" she sobbed. "I
      shall have you again. I shall have you again&mdash;all my own!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood and watched her meditatively. He was wondering why it was that
      grief like this had never touched him so before. His eyes were moist.
      Though he had been many things in his life, he had never been abashed; but
      a curious timidity possessed him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned over and touched her shoulder with a kindly abruptness, a
      friendly awkwardness. "Cheer up," he said. "You shall have your child, if
      Dauphin can help you to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he ever tries to take him from me"&mdash;she sprang to her feet, her
      face in a fury&mdash;"I will&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant her overpowering passion possessed her, and she stood
      violent and wilful; then, under his fixed, exacting gaze, her rage ceased;
      she became still and grey and quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall know to-morrow evening, Monsieur? Where?" Her voice was weak and
      distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought for a time. "At my house-at nine o'clock," he answered at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," she said, in a choking voice, "if I get my child again, I will
      bless you to my dying day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; it will be Dauphin you must bless," he said, and opened the door
      for her. As she disappeared into the dusk and silence he adjusted his
      eye-glass, and stared musingly after her, though there was nothing to see
      save the summer darkness, nothing to hear save the croak of the frogs in
      the village pond. He was thinking of the trial of Joseph Nadeau, and of a
      woman in the gallery, who laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, Monsieur," called the voice of the Notary from the bedroom.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. THE CURE AND THE SEIGNEUR VISIT THE TAILOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      It had been a perfect September day. The tailor of Chaudiere had been
      busier than usual, for winter was within hail, and careful habitants were
      renewing their simple wardrobes. The Seigneur and the Cure arrived
      together, each to order the making of a greatcoat of the Irish frieze
      which the Seigneur kept in quantity at the Manor. The Seigneur was in rare
      spirits. And not without reason; for this was Michaelmas eve, and tomorrow
      would be Michaelmas day, and there was a promise to be redeemed on
      Michaelmas day! He had high hopes of its redemption according to his own
      wishes; for he was a vain Seigneur, and he had had his way in all things
      all his life, as everybody knew. Importunity with discretion was his
      motto, and he often vowed to the Cure that there was no other motto for
      the modern world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure's visit to the tailor's shop on this particular day had unusual
      interest, for it concerned his dear ambition, the fondest aspiration of
      his life: to bring the infidel tailor (they could not but call a man an
      infidel whose soul was negative&mdash;the word agnostic had not then
      become usual) from the chains of captivity into the freedom of the Church.
      The Cure had ever clung to his fond hope; and it was due to his patient
      confidence that there were several parishioners who now carried Charley's
      name before the shrine of the blessed Virgin, and to the little calvaries
      by the road-side. The wife of Filion Lacasse never failed to pray for him
      every day. The thousand dollars gained by the saddler on the tailor's
      advice had made her life happier ever since, for Filion had become saving
      and prudent, and had even got her a "hired girl." There were at least a
      half-dozen other women, including Madame Dauphin, who did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he might listen again to the good priest on his holy hobby, inflamed
      with this passion of missionary zeal, the Seigneur, this morning, had
      thrown doubt upon the ultimate success of the Cure's efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Cure" said the Seigneur, "it is true, I think, what the tailor
      suggested to my brother&mdash;on my soul, I wonder the Abbe gave in, for a
      more obstinate fellow I never knew!&mdash;that a man is born with the
      disbelieving maggot in his brain, or the butterfly of belief, or whatever
      it may be called. It's constitutional&mdash;may be criminal, but
      constitutional. It seems to me you would stand more chance with the Jew,
      Greek, or heretic, than our infidel. He thinks too much&mdash;for a
      tailor, or for nine tailors, or for one man."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled his nose, as if he had said a very good thing indeed. They were
      walking slowly towards the village during this conversation, and the Cure,
      stopping short, brought his stick emphatically down in his palm several
      times, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you will not see! You will not understand. With God all things are
      possible. Were it the devil himself in human form, I should work and pray
      and hope, as my duty is, though he should still remain the devil to the
      end. What am I? Nothing. But what the Church has done, the Church may do.
      Think of Paul and Augustine, and Constantine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were classic barbarians to whom religion was but an emotion. This
      man has a brain which must be satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must count him as a soul to be saved through that very intelligence, as
      well as through the goodness of his daily life, which, in its charity,
      shames us all. He gives all he earns to the sick and needy. He lives on
      fare as poor as the poorest of our people eat; he gives up his hours of
      sleep to nurse the sick. Dauphin might not have lived but for him. His
      heart is good, else these things were impossible. He could not act them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's just it, Cure. Doesn't he act them? Isn't it a whim? What more
      likely than that, tired of the flesh-pots of Egypt, he comes here to live
      in the desert&mdash;for a sensation? We don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do know. The man has had sorrow and the man has had sin. Yes, believe
      me, there is none of us that suffers as this man has suffered. I have had
      many, many talks with him. Believe me, Maurice, I speak the truth. My
      heart bleeds for him. I think I know the thing that drove him here amongst
      us. It is a great temptation, which pursues him here&mdash;even here,
      where his life is so commendable. I have seen him fighting it. I have seen
      his torture, the piteous, ignoble yielding, and the struggle, with more
      than mortal energy, to be master of himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is&mdash;" the Seigneur said, then paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; do not ask me. He has not confessed to me, Maurice-naturally,
      nothing like that. But I know. I know and pity&mdash;ah, Maurice, I almost
      love. You argue, and reason, but I know this, my friend, that something
      was left out of this man when he was made, and it is that thing that we
      must find, or he will die among us a ruined soul, and his gravestone will
      be the monument of our shame. If he can once trust the Church, if he can
      once say, 'Lord, into Thy hands I commend my spirit,' then his temptation
      will vanish, and I shall bring him in&mdash;I shall lead him home."
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant the Seigneur looked at him in amazement, for this was a
      Cure he had never known.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Cure, you are not your old self," he said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not myself&mdash;yes, that is it, Maurice. I am not the old humdrum
      Cure you knew. The whole world is my field now. I have sorrowed for sin,
      within the bounds of this little Chaudiere. Now I sorrow for unbelief.
      Through this man, through much thinking on him, I have come to feel the
      woe of all the world. I have come to hear the footsteps of the Master
      near. My friend, it is not a legend, not a belief now, it is a presence. I
      owe him much, Maurice. In bringing him home, I shall understand what it
      all means&mdash;the faith that we profess. I shall in truth feel that it
      is all real. You see how much I may yet owe to him&mdash;to this infidel
      tailor. I only hope I have not betrayed him," he added anxiously. "I would
      keep faith with him&mdash;ah, yes, indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only remember that you have said the man suffers. That is no betrayal."
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the village in silence. Presently, however, the sound of
      Maximilian Cour's violin, as they passed the bakery, set the Seigneur's
      tongue wagging again, and it wagged on till they came to the tailor's
      shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-day to you, Monsieur," he said, as they entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you a hot goose for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have, but I will not press it on you," replied Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should you so take my question&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should you so take my 'anser'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The pun was new to the Seigneur, and he turned to the Cure chuckling.
      "Think of that, Cure! He knows the classics." He laughed till the tears
      came into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few moments Charley was busy measuring the two potentates for
      greatcoats. As it was his first work for them, it was necessary for the
      Cure to write down the Seigneur's measurements, as the tailor called them
      off, while the Seigneur did the same when the Cure was being measured. So
      intent were the three it might have been a conference of war. The Seigneur
      ventured a distant but self-conscious smile when the measurement of his
      waist was called, for he had by two inches the advantage of the Cure,
      though they were the same age, while he was one inch better in the chest.
      The Seigneur was proud of his figure, and, unheeding the passing of
      fashions, held to the knee-breeches and silk stockings long after they had
      disappeared from the province. To the Cure he had often said that the only
      time he ever felt heretical was when in the presence of the gaitered
      calves of a Protestant dean. He wore his sleeves tight and his stock high,
      as in the days when William the Sailor was king in England, and his long
      gold-topped Prince Regent cane was the very acme of dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The measurement done, the three studied the fashion plates&mdash;mostly
      five years old&mdash;as Von Moltke and Bismarck might have studied the
      field of Gravelotte. The Seigneur's remarks were highly critical, till,
      with a few hasty strokes on brown paper, Charley sketched in his figure
      with a long overcoat in style much the same as his undercoat, stately and
      flowing and confined at the waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirable, most admirable!" said the Seigneur. "The likeness is
      astonishing"&mdash;he admired the carriage of his own head in Charley's
      swift lines&mdash;"the garment in perfect taste. Form&mdash;there is
      nothing like form and proportion in life. It is almost a religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear friend!" said the Cure, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know when I am in the presence of an artist and his work. Louis Trudel
      had rule and measure, shears and a needle. Our friend here has eye and
      head, sense of form and creative gift. Ah, Cure, Cure, if I were
      twenty-five, with the assistance of Monsieur, I would show the bucks in
      Fabrique Street how to dress. What style is this called, Monsieur?" he
      suddenly asked, pointing to the drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Style a la Rossignol, Seigneur," said the tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur was flattered out of all reason. He looked across at the
      post-office, where he could see Rosalie dimly moving in the shade of the
      shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, if I had but ordered this coat sooner!" he said regretfully. He was
      thinking that to-morrow was Michaelmas day, when he was to ask Rosalie for
      her answer again, and he fancied himself appearing before her in the
      gentle cool of the evening, in this coat, lightly thrown back, disclosing
      his embroidered waistcoat, seals, and snowy linen. "Monsieur, I am highly
      complimented, believe me," he said. "Observe, Cure, that this coat is
      invented for me on the spot."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure nodded appreciatively. "Wonderful! Wonderful! But do you not
      think," he added, a little wistfully&mdash;for, was he not a Frenchman,
      susceptible like all his race to the appearance of things?&mdash;"do you
      not think it might be too fashionable for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a whit&mdash;not a whit," replied the Seigneur generously. "Should
      not a Cure look distinguished&mdash;be dignified? Consider the length, the
      line, the eloquence of design! Ah, Monsieur, once again, you are an
      artist! The Cure shall wear it&mdash;indeed but he shall! Then I shall
      look like him, and perhaps get credit for some of his perfections."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the Cure?" said Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Cure?&mdash;the Cure? Tiens, a little of my worldliness will do him
      good. There are no contrasts in him. He must wear the coat." He waved his
      walking-stick complacently, for he was thinking that the Cure's less
      perfect figure would set off his own well as they walked together. "May I
      have the honour to keep this as a souvenir?" he added, picking up the
      sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With pleasure," answered Charley. "You do not need it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure looked a little disappointed, and Charley, seeing, immediately
      sketched on brown paper the priestly figure in the new-created coat, a la
      Rossignol. On this drawing he was a little longer engaged, with the result
      that the Cure was reproduced with a singular fidelity&mdash;in face,
      figure, and expression a personality gentle yet important.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my soul, you shall not have it!" said the Seigneur. "But you shall
      have me, and I shall have you, lest we both grow vain by looking at
      ourselves." He thrust the sketch of himself into the Cure's hands, and
      carefully rolled up that of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure was amazed at this gift of the tailor, and delighted with the
      picture of himself&mdash;his vanity was as that of a child, without guile
      or worldliness. He was better pleased, however, to have the drawing of his
      friend by him, that vanity might not be too companionable. He thanked
      Charley with a beaming face, and then the two friends bowed and moved
      towards the door. Suddenly the Cure stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Maurice," said he, "we have forgotten the important thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think of that&mdash;we two old babblers!" said the Seigneur. He nodded
      for the Cure to begin. "Monsieur," said the Cure to Charley, "you maybe
      able to help us in a little difficulty. For a long time we have intended
      holding a great mission with a kind of religious drama like that performed
      at Ober-Ammergau, and called The Passion Play. You know of it, Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well through reading, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next Easter we propose having a Passion Play in pious imitation of the
      famous drama. We will hold it at the Indian reservation of Four Mountains,
      thus quickening our own souls and giving a good object-lesson of the great
      History to the Indians."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure paused rather anxiously, but Charley did not speak. His eyes were
      fixed inquiringly on the Cure, and he had a sudden suspicion that some
      devious means were forward to influence him. He dismissed the thought,
      however, for this Cure was simple as man ever was made, straightforward as
      the most heretical layman might demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure, taking heart, again continued: "Now I possess an authentic
      description of the Ober-Ammergau drama, giving details of its presentation
      at different periods, and also a book of the play. But there is no one in
      the parish who reads German, and it occurred to the Seigneur and myself
      that, understanding French so well, by chance you may understand German
      also, and would, perhaps, translate the work for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I read German easily and speak it fairly," Charley answered, relieved;
      "and you are welcome to my services."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure's pale face flushed with pleasure. He took the little German book
      from his pocket, and handed it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not so very long," he said; "and we shall all be grateful." Then an
      inspiration came to him; his eyes lighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," he said, "you will notice that there are no illustrations in
      the book. It is possible that you might be able to make us a few drawings&mdash;if
      we do not ask too much? It would aid greatly in the matter of costume, and
      you might use my library&mdash;I have a fair number of histories." The
      Cure was almost breathless, his heart thumped as he made the request.
      After a slight pause he added, hastily: "You are always doing for others.
      It is hardly kind to ask you; but we have some months to spare; there need
      be no haste." Charley hastened to relieve the Cure's anxiety. "Do not
      apologise," he said. "I will do what I can when I can. But as for drawing,
      Monsieur, it will be but amateurish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," interposed the Seigneur promptly, "if you're not an artist,
      I'm damned!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maurice!" murmured the Cure reproachfully. "Can't help it, Cure. I've
      held it in for an hour. It had to come; so there it is exploded. I see no
      damage either, save to my own reputation. Monsieur," he added to Charley,
      "if I had gifts like yours, nothing would hold me. I should put on more
      airs than Beauty Steele."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate that, at that instant, Charley's face was turned away, or
      the Seigneur would have seen it go white and startled. Charley did not
      dare turn his head for the moment. He could not speak. What did the
      Seigneur know of Beauty Steele?
    </p>
    <p>
      To hide his momentary confusion, he went over to the drawer of a cupboard
      in the wall, and placed the book inside. It gave him time to recover
      himself. When he turned round again his face was calm, his manner
      composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who, may I ask, is Beauty Steele?" he said. "Faith I do not know,"
      answered the Seigneur, taking a pinch of snuff. "It's years since I first
      read the phrase in a letter a scamp of a relative of mine wrote me from
      the West. He had met a man of the name, who had a reputation as a clever
      fop, a very handsome fellow. So I thought it a good phrase, and I've used
      it ever since on occasions. 'More airs than Beauty Steele.'&mdash;It has a
      sound; it's effective, I fancy, Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Decidedly effective," answered Charley quietly. He picked up his shears.
      "You will excuse me," he said grimly, "but I must earn my living. I cannot
      live on my reputation."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur and the Cure lifted their hats&mdash;to the tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Au revoir, Monsieur," they both said, and Charley bowed them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two friends turned to each other a little way up the street.
      "Something will come of this, Cure," said the Seigneur. The Cure, whose
      face had a look of happiness, pressed his arm in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the tailor-shop, a voice kept saying, "More airs than Beauty
      Steele!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. THE SCARLET WOMAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since the evening in the garden when she had been drawn into Charley's
      arms, and then fled from them in joyful confusion, Rosalie had been in a
      dream. She had not closed her eyes all night, or, if she closed them, they
      still saw beautiful things flashing by, to be succeeded by other beautiful
      things. It was a roseate world. To her simple nature it was not so
      important to be loved as to love. Selfishness was as yet the minor part of
      her. She had been giving all her life&mdash;to her mother, as a child; to
      sisters at the convent who had been kind to her; to the poor and the sick
      of the parish; to her father, who was helpless without her; to the tailor
      across the way. In each case she had given more than she had got. A nature
      overflowing with impulsive affection, it must spend itself upon others.
      The maternal instinct was at the very core of her nature, and care for
      others was as much a habit as an instinct with her. She had love to give,
      and it must be given. It had been poured like the rain from heaven on the
      just and the unjust; on animals as on human beings, and in so far as her
      nature, in the first spring&mdash;the very April&mdash;of its powers,
      could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till Charley had come to Chaudiere, it had all been the undisciplined
      ardour of a girl's nature. A change had begun in the moment when she had
      tearfully thrust the oil and flour in upon his excoriated breast. Later
      came real awakening, and a riotous outpouring of herself in sympathy, in
      observation, in a reckless kindness which must have done her harm but that
      her clear intelligence balanced her actions, and because secrecy in one
      thing helped to restrain her in all. Yet with all the fresh overflow of
      her spirit, which, assisted by her new position as postmistress, made her
      a conspicuous and popular figure in the parish, where officialdom had rare
      honour and little labour, she had prejudices almost unworthy of her, due
      though they were to radical antipathy. These prejudices, one against Jo
      Portugais and the other against Paulette Dubois, she had never been able
      entirely to overcome, though she had honestly tried. On the way to the
      hospital at Quebec, however, Jo had been so careful of her father, so
      respectful when speaking of M'sieu', so regardful of her own comfort, that
      her antagonism to him was lulled. But the strong prejudice against
      Paulette Dubois remained, casting a shadow on her bright spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this day she had moved about in a mellow dream, very busy, scarcely
      thinking. New feelings dominated her, and she was too primitive to analyse
      them and too occupied with them to realise acutely the life about her.
      Work was an abstraction, resting rather than tiring her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many times she had looked across at the tailor-shop, only seeing Charley
      once. She did not wish to speak with him now, nor to be near him yet; she
      wanted this day for herself only.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that, soon after the Cure and the Seigneur had bade good-bye to
      Charley, she left the post-office and went quickly through the village to
      a spot by the river, where was a place called the Rest of the Flaxbeaters.
      It was an overhanging rock which made a kind of canopy over a sweet
      spring, where, in the days when their labours sounded through the valley,
      the flaxbeaters from the level below came to eat their meals and to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had always been a resort for her in the months when the flax-beaters
      did not use it. Since a child she had made the place her own. To this day
      it is called Rosalie's Dell; for are not her sorrows and joys still told
      by those who knew and loved her? and is not the parish still fragrant with
      her name? Has not her history become a living legend a thousand times
      told?
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the village behind her, Rosalie passed down the high-road till she
      came to a path that led off through a grove of scattered pines. There
      would be yet a half-hour's sun and then a short twilight, and the river
      and the woods and the Rest of the Flax-beaters would be her own; and she
      could think of the wonderful thing come upon her. She had brought with her
      a book of English poems, and as she went through the grove she opened it,
      and in her pretty English repeated over and over to herself:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "My heart is thine, and soul and body render
     Faith to thy faith; I give nor hold in thrall:
     Take all, dear love! thou art my life's defender;
     Speak to my soul! Take life and love; take all!"
</pre>
    <p>
      She was lifted up by the abandonment of the verse, by the fulness of her
      own feelings, which had only needed a touch of beauty to give it
      exaltation. The touch had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on abstractedly to the place where she had trysted with her
      thoughts only, these many years, and, sitting down, watched the sun sink
      beyond the trees, the shades of evening fall. All that had happened since
      Charley came to the parish she went over in her mind. She remembered the
      day he had said this, the day he had said that; she brought back the night&mdash;it
      was etched upon her mind!&mdash;when he had said to her, "You have saved
      my life, Mademoiselle!" She recalled the time she put the little cross
      back on the church-door, the ghostly footsteps in the church, the light,
      the lost hood. A shudder ran through her now, for the mystery of that hood
      had never been cleared up. But the words on the page caught her eye again:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "My heart is thine, and soul and body render
     Faith to thy faith..."
</pre>
    <p>
      It swallowed up the moment's agitation. Never till this day, never till
      last night, had she dared to say to herself, He loves me. He seemed so far
      above her&mdash;she never had thought of him as a tailor!&mdash;that she
      had given and never dared hope to receive, had lived without anticipation
      lest there should come despair. Even that day at Vadrome Mountain she had
      not thought he meant love, when he had said to her that he would remember
      to the last. When he had said that he would die for love's sake, he had
      not meant her, but others&mdash;some one else whom he would save by his
      death. Kathleen, that name which had haunted her&mdash;ah, whoever
      Kathleen was, or whatever Kathleen had to do with him or his life, she had
      no reason to fear Kathleen now. She had no reason to fear any one; for had
      she not heard his words of love as he clasped her in his arms last night?
      Had she not fled from that enfolding, because her heart was so full in the
      hour of her triumph that she could not bear more, could not look longer
      into the eyes to which she had told her love before his was spoken?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of her thoughts she heard footsteps. She started up. Paulette
      Dubois suddenly appeared in the path below. She had taken the river-path
      down from Vadrome Mountain, where she had gone to see Jo Portugais, who
      had not yet returned from Quebec. Paulette's face was agitated, her manner
      nervous. For nights she had not slept, and her approaching meeting with
      the tailor had made her tremble all day. Excited as she was, there was a
      wild sort of beauty in her face, and her figure was lithe and supple. She
      dressed always a little garishly, but now there was only that band of
      colour round the throat, worn last night in the talk with Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      To both women this meeting was as a personal misfortune, a mutual affront.
      Each had a natural antipathy. To Rosalie the invasion of her beloved
      retreat was as hateful as though the woman had purposely intruded.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they confronted each other without speaking, then Rosalie's
      natural courtesy, her instinctive good-heartedness, overcame her
      irritation, and she said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-evening, Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not Madame, and you know it," answered the woman harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry. Good-evening, Mademoiselle," rejoined Rosalie evenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wanted to insult me. You knew I wasn't Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie shook her head. "How should I know? You have not always lived in
      Chaudiere, you have lived in Montreal, and people often call you Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know better. You know that letters come to me from Montreal addressed
      Mademoiselle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie turned as if to go. "I do not recall what letters pass through the
      post-office. I have a good memory for forgetting. Good-evening," she
      added, with an excess of courtesy. Paulette read the placid scorn in the
      girl's face; she did not see and would not understand that Rosalie did not
      scorn her for what she had ever done, but for something that she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think I am the dirt under your feet," she said, now white, now red,
      and mad with anger. "I'm not fit to speak with you&mdash;I'm a rag for the
      dust pile!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never thought so," answered Rosalie. "I have not liked you, but I
      am sorry for you, and I never thought those things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie!" was the rejoinder; and Rosalie, turning away quickly with
      trouble in her face, put her hands to her ears, and, hastening down the
      hillside, did not hear the words the woman called after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow every one shall know you are a thief. Run, run, run! You can
      hear what I say, white-face! They shall know about the little cross
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed Rosalie at a distance, her eyes blazing. As fate would have
      it, she met on the highroad the least scrupulous man in the parish, an
      inveterate gossip, the keeper of the general store, whose only opposition
      in business was the post-office shop. He was the centre of the village
      tittle-tattle, and worse. With malicious speed Paulette told him how she
      had seen Rosalie Evanturel nailing the little cross on the church door of
      a certain night. If he wanted proof of what she said, let him ask Jo
      Portugais.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having spat out her revenge, she went on to the village, and through it to
      her house, where she prepared to visit the shop of the tailor. Her sense
      of retaliation satisfied, Rosalie passed from her mind; her child only
      occupied it. In another hour she would know where her child was&mdash;the
      tailor had promised that she should. Then perhaps she would be sorry for
      the accident to the Notary; for it was an accident, in spite of
      appearances.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark when Paulette entered the door of the tailor's house. When she
      came out, a half-hour later, with elation in her carriage, and tears of
      joy running down her face, she did not look about her; she did not care
      whether or not any one saw her: she was possessed with only one thought&mdash;her
      child! She passed like a swift wind down the street, making for home and
      for her departure to the hiding-place of her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not seen a figure in the shadow of a tree near by as she came from
      the tailor's door. She had not heard a smothered cry behind her. She was
      not aware that in unspeakable agony another woman knocked softly at the
      door of the tailor's house, and, not waiting for an answer, opened it and
      entered. It was Rosalie Evanturel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. AS IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING
    </h2>
    <p>
      The kitchen was empty, but light fell through the door of the shop opening
      upon the little hall between. Rosalie crossed the hall and stood in the
      doorway of the shop, a figure of concentrated indignation, despair, and
      shame. Leaning on his elbow Charley was bending over a book in the light
      of a candle on the bench be side him. He was reading aloud, translating
      into English the German text of the narrative the Cure had given him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "And because of this divine interposition, consequent upon their
   faithful prayers and their oblations, they did perform these holy
   scenes from season to season, with solemn proof of piety and godly
   living, so that it seemed the life of the Lord our Shepherd was ever
   present with them, as though, indeed, Ober-Ammergau were Nazareth or
   Jerusalem. And the hearts of all in the land did answer daily to
   that sweet and lively faith, insomuch that even in times of war the
   zeal of the people became an holy zeal, and their warfare noble; so
   that they did accept both victory and defeat with equal humbleness.
   Because there was no war in their hearts, but peace, and they did
   fight to defend and not to acquire, they buried their foe with tears
   and their own with singleness of heart and quiet joy, for that they
   did rest from their labours. In this manner was the great tragedy
   and glory of the world made to the people a present thing,
   transforming them to the body of the Life that hath neither spot nor
   blemish nor..."
</pre>
    <p>
      Charley had not heard Rosalie enter, nor her footsteps in the hall. But
      now there ran through his reading a thread of something not of himself or
      of it. He had thrilled to the archaic but clear-hearted style of the old
      German chronicler, and the warmth he felt had passed into his voice, so
      that it became louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Rosalie listened to his reading, a hundred thoughts rushed through her
      mind. Paulette Dubois, the wanton woman, had just left his doorway
      secretly, yet there he was, instantly after, calmly reading a pious book!
      Her mind was in tumult. She could not reason, she could not rule her
      judgment. She only knew that the woman had come from this house, and
      hurried guiltily away into the dark. She only knew that the man the woman
      had left here was the man she loved&mdash;loved more than her life, for he
      embodied all her past; all her present&mdash;she knew that she could not
      live without him; all her future&mdash;for where he went she would go,
      whatever the fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her judgment had been swept from its moorings. She had been carried on the
      wave of her heart's fever into this room, not daring to think this or
      that, not planning this or that, not accusing, not reproaching, not
      shaming herself and him by black suspicion, but blindly, madly demanding
      to see him, to look into his eyes, to hear his voice, to know him,
      whatever he was&mdash;man, lover, or devil. She was a child-woman&mdash;a
      child in her primitive feelings that threw aside all convention, because
      there was no wrong in her heart; a woman, because she was possessed by a
      jealousy which shamed and angered her, because its very existence put him
      on trial, condemned him. Her soul was the sport of emotions and passions
      stronger than herself, because the heritage, the instinct, of all the race
      of women, the eternal predisposition. At the moment her will was not
      sufficient to rule them to obedience. She was in the first subservience to
      that power which feeds the streams of human history.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she now listened to Charley reading, a sudden revulsion of feeling came
      over her. Some note in his voice reassured her heart&mdash;if it needed
      reassuring. The quiet force of his presence stilled the tumult in her, so
      that her eyes could see without mist, her heart beat without agony; but
      every pulse in her was throbbing, every instinct was alive. Presently
      there rushed upon her the words that had rung in her ears and chimed in
      her heart at the Rest of the Flax-beaters:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Take all, dear love! thou art my life's defender;
     Speak to my soul! Take life and love; take all."
</pre>
    <p>
      Feelings lying beneath the mad conflict of emotion which had sent her into
      this room in such unmaidenly fashion&mdash;feelings that were her deepest
      self-welled up. Her breath came hard and broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Charley read on, a breathing seemed to answer his own. It became
      quicker than his own, it pierced the stillness, it filled the room with
      feeling, it came calling to him out of the silence. He swung round, and
      saw the girl in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie!" he cried, and sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a piteously pathetic cry, she flung herself on her knees beside the
      tailor's bench where he worked every day, and, burying her face in her
      arms as they rested on the bench, wept bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie!" he said anxiously, leaning over her. "What is the matter? What
      has happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She wept more bitterly still; she made a despairing gesture. His hand
      touched her hair; he dropped on a knee beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am so ashamed, ashamed! I have been so wicked," she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie, what has happened?" he urged gently. His own heart was beating
      hard, his own eyes were responding to hers. The new feelings alive in him,
      the forces his love had awakened, which, last night, had kept him
      sleepless, and had been upon him like a dream all day&mdash;they were at
      height in him now. He knew not how to command them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie, dearest, tell me all!" he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never&mdash;I have been&mdash;oh&mdash;you will never forgive
      me!" she said brokenly. "I knew it wasn't true, but I couldn't help it. I
      saw her&mdash;the woman&mdash;come from your house, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! For God's sake, hush!" he broke in almost harshly. Then a better
      understanding came upon him, and it made him gentle with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Rosalie, you did not think! But&mdash;but it was natural you should
      wish to see me...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, as soon as I saw you, I knew that&mdash;that&mdash;" She broke down
      again and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you about her, Rosalie&mdash;" His fingers stroked her hair,
      and, bending over her, his face was near her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, tell me nothing&mdash;oh, if you tell me!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She came to hear from me what she ought to have heard from the Notary.
      She has had great trouble&mdash;the man&mdash;her child&mdash;and I have
      helped her, told her&mdash;" His face was so near now that his breath was
      on her hair. She suddenly raised her head and clasped his face in her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew&mdash;oh, I knew, I knew...!" she wept, and her eyes drank his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie, my life!" he cried, clasping her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The love that was in him, new-born and but half understood, poured itself
      out in broken words like her own. For him there was no outside world; no
      past, no Kathleen, no Billy; no suspicion, or infidelity, or unfaith; no
      fear of disaster; no terrors of the future. Life was Now to him and to
      her: nothing brooded behind, nothing lay before. The candle spluttered and
      burnt low in the socket.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. IT WAS MICHAELMAS DAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not a cloud in the sky, and, ruling all, a sweet sun, liberal in warmth
      and eager in brightness as its distance from the northern world decreased.
      As Mrs. Flynn entered the door of the post-office she sang out to
      Maximilian Cour, with a buoyant lilt: "Oh, isn't it the fun o' the world
      to be alive!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The tailor over the way heard it, and lifted his head with a smile;
      Rosalie Evanturel, behind the postal wicket, heard it, and her face swam
      with colour. Rosalie busied herself with the letters and papers for a
      moment before she answered Mrs. Flynn's greeting, for there were ringing
      in her ears the words she herself had said a few days before: "It is good
      to live, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day it was so good to live that life seemed an endless being and a
      tireless happy doing&mdash;a gift of labour, an inspiring daytime, and a
      rejoicing sleep. Exaltation, a painful joy, and a wide embarrassing
      wonderment possessed her. She met Mrs. Flynn's face at the wicket with
      shining eyes and a timid smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, there y'are, darlin'!" said Mrs. Flynn. "And how's the dear father
      to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He seems about the same, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that's foine. Shure, if we could always be 'about the same,' we'd do.
      True for you, darlin', 'tis as you say. If ould Mary Flynn could be always
      ''bout the same,' the clods o' the valley would never cover her bones. But
      there 'tis&mdash;we're here to-day, and away tomorrow. Shure, though, I am
      not complainin'. Not I&mdash;not Mary Flynn. Teddy Flynn used to say to
      me, says he: 'Niver born to know distress! Happy as worms in a garden av
      cucumbers. Seventeen years in this country, Mary,' says he, 'an' nivir in
      the pinitintiary yet.' There y'are. Ah, the birds do be singin' to-day!
      'Tis good! 'Tis good, darlin'! You'll not mind Mary Flynn callin' you
      darlin', though y'are postmistress, an' 'll be more than that&mdash;more
      than that wan day&mdash;or Mary Flynn's a fool. Aye, more than that y'll
      be, darlin', and y're eyes like purty brown topazzes and y're cheeks like
      roses-shure, is there anny lether for Mary Flynn, darlin'?" she hastily
      added as she saw the Seigneur standing in the doorway. He had evidently
      been listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye didn't hear what y're ould fool of a cook was sayin'," she added to
      the Seigneur, as Rosalie shook her head and answered: "No letters, Madame&mdash;dear."
      Rosalie timidly added the dear, for there was something so great-hearted
      in Mrs. Flynn that she longed to clasp her round the neck, longed as she
      had never done in her life to lay her head upon some motherly breast and
      pour out her heart. But it was not to be now. Secrecy was her duty still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't ye speak to y're ould fool of a cook, sir?" Mrs. Flynn said again,
      as the Seigneur made way for her to leave the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you guess?" he said to her in a low voice, his sharp eyes peering
      into hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the looks in y're face these past weeks, and the look in hers," she
      whispered, and went on her way rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll wind thim both round me finger like a wisp o' straw," she said,
      going up the road with a light step, despite her weight, till she was
      stopped by the malicious grocer-man of the village, whose tongue had been
      wagging for hours upon an unwholesome theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in the post-office, the Seigneur and Rosalie were face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Michaelmas day," he said. "May I speak with you, Mademoiselle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the clock. It was on the stroke of noon. The shop always
      closed from twelve till half-past twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you step into the parlour, Monsieur?" she said, and coming round the
      counter, locked the shop-door. She was trembling and confused, and entered
      the little parlour shyly. Yet her eyes met the Seigneur's bravely. "Your
      father, how is he?" he said, offering her a chair. The sunlight streaming
      in the window made a sort of pathway of light between them, while they
      were in the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He seems no worse, and to-day he is wheeling himself about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is stronger, then&mdash;that's good. Is there any fear that he must go
      to the hospital again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She inclined her head. "The doctor says he may have to go any moment. It
      may be his one chance. The Cure is very kind, and says that, with your
      permission, his sister will keep the office here, if&mdash;if needed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur nodded briskly. "Of course, of course. But have you not
      thought that we might secure another postmistress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face clouded a little; her heart beat hard. She knew what was coming.
      She dreaded it, but it was better to have it over now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We could not live without it," she said helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What we have saved is not enough. The little my mother had must pay for
      the visits to the hospital. I have kept it for that. You see, I need the
      place here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have thought, just the same. Do you not know the day?" he asked
      meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come to ask you to marry me&mdash;this is Michaelmas day,
      Rosalie."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak. He had hopes from her silence. "If anything happened to
      your father, you could not live here alone&mdash;but a young girl! Your
      father may be in the hospital for a long time. You cannot afford that. If
      I were to offer you money, you would refuse. If you marry me, all that I
      have is yours to dispose of at your will: to make others happy, to take
      you now and then from this narrow place, to see what's going on in the
      world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am happy here," she said falteringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chaudiere is the finest place in the world," he replied proudly, and as a
      matter of fact. "But, for the sake of knowledge, you should see what the
      rest of the world is. It helps you to understand Chaudiere better. I ask
      you to be my wife, Rosalie."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said before, it was not because I am old, not because I am rich, not
      because I am Seigneur, not because I am I, that you refused me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him now. "That is true," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what reason can you have? None, none. 'Pon honour, I believe you are
      afraid of marriage because it's marriage. By my life, there's naught to
      dread. A little giving here and taking there, and it's easy. And when a
      woman is all that's good, to a man, it can be done without fear or
      trembling. Even the Cure would tell you that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I know, I know," she said, in a voice half painful, half joyous. "I
      know that it is so. But, oh, dear Monsieur, I cannot marry you&mdash;never&mdash;never."
    </p>
    <p>
      He hung on bravely. "I want to make life easy and happy for you. I want
      the right to do so. When trouble comes upon you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When it does I will turn to you&mdash;ah, yes, I would turn to you
      without fear, dear Monsieur," she said, and her heart ached within her,
      for a premonition of sorrow came upon her and filled her eyes, and made
      her heart like lead within her breast. "I know how true a gentleman you
      are," she added. "I could give you everything but that which is life to
      me, which is being, and soul, and the beginning and the end."
    </p>
    <p>
      The weight of the revealing hour of her life, its wonder, its agony, its
      irrevocability, was upon her. It was giving new meanings to
      existence-primitive woman, child of nature as she was. All morning she had
      longed to go out into the woods and bury herself among the ferns and
      bracken, and laugh and weep for very excess of feeling, downright joy and
      vague woe possessing her at once. She looked the Seigneur in the eyes with
      consuming earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is not because I am young," she said, in a low voice, "for I am
      old&mdash;indeed, I am very old. It is because I cannot love you, and
      never can love you in the one great way; and I will not marry without
      love. My heart is fixed on that. When I marry, it will be when I love a
      man so much that I cannot live without him. If he is so poor that each
      meal is a miracle, it will make no difference. Oh, can't you see, can't
      you feel, what I mean, Monsieur&mdash;you who are so wise and learned, and
      know the world so well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wise and learned!" he said, a little roughly, for his voice was husky
      with emotion. "'Pon honour, I think I am a fool! A bewildered fool, that
      knows no more of woman than my cook knows Sanscrit. Faith, a hundred times
      less! For Mary Flynn's got an eye to see, and, without telling, she knew I
      had a mind set on you. But Mary Flynn thought more than that, for she has
      an idea that you've a mind set on some one, Rosalie. She thought it might
      be me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman is not so easily read as a man," she replied, half smiling, but
      with her eyes turned to the street. A few people were gathering in front
      of the house&mdash;she wondered why.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is some one else&mdash;that is it, Rosalie. There is some one else.
      You shall tell me who it is. You shall&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short, for there was a loud knocking at the shop-door, and the
      voice of M. Evanturel calling: "Rosalie! Rosalie! Rosalie! Ah, come
      quickly&mdash;ah, my Rosalie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a look at the Seigneur, Rosalie rushed into the shop and opened
      the front door. Her father was deathly pale, and was trembling violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie, my bird," he cried indignantly, "they're saying you stole the
      cross from the church door."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now wheeled inside the shop, and people gathered round, looking at
      him and Rosalie, some covertly, some as friends, some in a half-frightened
      way, as though strange things were about to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shure, 'tis a lie, or me name's not Mary Flynn&mdash;the darlin'!" said
      the Seigneur's cook, with blazing face. "Who makes this charge?" roared an
      angry voice. No one had seen the Seigneur enter from the little room
      beside the shop, and at the sound of the sharp voice the people fell back,
      for he was as free with his stick as his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," said the grocer, to whom Paulette Dubois had told her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye shall be tarred and feathered before y'are a day older," said Mary
      Flynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie was very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur was struck by this and by the strangeness of her look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clear the room," he said to Filion Lacasse, who was now a constable of
      the parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet!" said a voice at the doorway. "What is the trouble?" It was the
      Cure, who had already heard rumours of the scandal, and had come at once
      to Rosalie. M. Evanturel tried to speak, and could not. But Mary Flynn
      did, with a face like a piece of scarlet bunting. Having finished with a
      flourish, she could scarce keep her hands off the cowardly grocer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure turned to Rosalie. "It is absurd," he said. "Forgive me," he
      added to the Seigneur. "It is better that Rosalie should answer this
      charge. If she gives her word of honour, I will deny communion to whoever
      slanders her hereafter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She did it," said the grocer stubbornly. "She can't deny it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Answer, Rosalie," said the Cure firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me; I will answer," said a voice at the door. The tailor of
      Chaudiere made his way into the shop, through the fast-gathering crowd.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII. A TRIAL AND A VERDICT
    </h2>
    <p>
      "What right have you to answer for mademoiselle?" said the Seigneur, with
      a sudden rush of jealousy. Was not he alone the protector of Rosalie
      Evanturel? Yet here was mystery, and it was clear the tailor had something
      important to say. M. Rossignol offered the Cure a chair, seated himself on
      a small bench, and gently drew Rosalie down beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will make this a court," said he. "Advance, grocer."
    </p>
    <p>
      The grocer came forward smugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On what information do you make this charge against mademoiselle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The grocer volubly related all that Paulette Dubois had said. As he told
      his tale the Cure's face was a study, for the night the cross was restored
      came back to him, and the events, so far as he knew them, were in keeping
      with the grocer's narrative. He looked at Rosalie anxiously. Monsieur
      Evanturel moaned, for he remembered he had heard Rosalie come in very late
      that night. Yet he fixed his eyes on her in dog-like faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle will admit that this is true, I presume," said Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie looked at him intently, as though to read his very heart. It was
      clear that he wished her to say yes; and what he wished was law.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite true," answered Rosalie calmly, and all fear passed from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she did not steal the cross," continued Charley, in a louder voice,
      that all might hear, for people were gathering fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she didn't steal it, why was she putting it back on the church door in
      the dark?" said the grocer. "Ah, hould y'r head, ould sand-in-the-sugar!"
      said Mrs. Flynn, her fingers aching to get into his hair. "Silence!" said
      the Seigneur severely, and looked inquiringly at Rosalie. Rosalie looked
      at Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not a question of why mademoiselle put the cross back," he said.
      "It is a question of who took the cross away, is it not? Suppose it was
      not a theft. Suppose that the person who took the relic thought to do a
      pious act&mdash;for your Church, Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not see," the Cure answered helplessly. "It was a secret act,
      therefore suspicious at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Let your good gifts be in secret, and your Heavenly Father who seeth in
      secret will reward you openly,"' answered Charley. "That, I believe, is a
      principle you teach, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At one time Monsieur the tailor was thought to have taken the cross,"
      said the Seigneur suggestively. "Perhaps Monsieur was secretly doing good
      with it?" he added. It vexed him that there should be a secret between
      Rosalie and this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It had to do with me, not I with it," he answered evenly. He must travel
      wide at first to convince their narrow brains. "Mademoiselle did a kind
      act when she nailed that cross on the church door again&mdash;to make a
      dead man rest easier in his grave."
    </p>
    <p>
      A hush fell upon the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie looked at Charley in surprise; but she saw his meaning presently&mdash;that
      what she did for him must seem to have been done for the dead tailor only.
      Her heart beat hot with indignation, for she would, if she but might, cry
      her love gladly from the hill-tops of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alight began to break upon the Cure's mind. "Will Monsieur speak plainly?"
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not see Louis Trudel take the cross, but I know that he did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Louis Trudel! Louis Trudel!" interposed the Seigneur anxiously. "What
      does this mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur speaks the truth," interposed Rosalie. The Cure recalled the
      death-bed of Louis Trudel, and the dying man's strange agitation. He also
      recalled old Margot's death, and her wish to confess some one else's
      wrong-doing. He was convinced that Charley was speaking the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true," added Charley slowly; "but you may think none the worse of
      him when you know all. He took the cross for temporary use, and before he
      could replace it he died."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know what he meant, or did not mean?" said the Seigneur in
      perplexity. "Did he take you into his confidence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very closest," answered Charley grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet he looked upon you as an infidel, and said hard things of you on his
      death-bed," urged the Cure anxiously. He could not see the end of the
      tale, and he was troubled for both the dead man and the living.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was why he took me into his confidence. I will explain. I have not
      the honour to have the fulness of your Christian faith, Monsieur le Cure.
      I had asked him to show me a sign from heaven, and he showed it by the
      little iron cross."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't make anything of that," said the Seigneur peevishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie sprang to her feet. "He will not tell the whole truth, Messieurs,
      but I will. With that little cross Louis Trudel would have killed
      Monsieur, had it not been for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      A gasp of excitement went out from those who stood by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But for you, Rosalie?" asked the Cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But for me. I saw Louis Trudel raise an iron against Monsieur that day in
      the shop. It made me nervous&mdash;I thought he was mad. So I watched.
      That night I saw a light in the tailor-shop late. I thought it strange. I
      went over and peeped through the cracks of the shutters. I saw old Louis
      at the fire with the little cross, red-hot. I knew he meant trouble. I ran
      into the house. Old Margot was beside herself with fear&mdash;she had seen
      also. I ran through the hall and saw old Louis upstairs with the burning
      cross. I followed. He went into Monsieur's room. When I got to the door"&mdash;she
      paused, trembling, for she saw Charley's reproving eyes upon her&mdash;"I
      saw him with the cross&mdash;with the cross raised over Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He meant to threaten me," interposed Charley quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will have the truth!" said the Seigneur, in a husky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The cross came down on Monsieur's bare breast." The grocer laughed
      vindictively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence!" growled the Seigneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence!" said Filion Lacasse, and dropped his hand on the grocer's
      shoulder. "I'll baste you with a stirrup-strap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rest is well known," quickly interposed Charley. "The poor man was
      mad. He thought it a pious act to mark an infidel with the cross."
    </p>
    <p>
      Every eye was fixed upon him. The Cure remembered Louis Trudel's last
      words: "Look&mdash;look&mdash;I gave&mdash;him&mdash;the sign&mdash;of...!"
      Old Margot's words also kept ringing in his ears. He turned to the
      Seigneur. "Monsieur," said he, "we have heard the truth. That act of Louis
      Trudel was cruel and murderous. May God forgive him! I will not say that
      mademoiselle did well in keeping silent&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless the darlin'!" cried Mrs. Flynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;but I will say that she meant to do a kind act for a man's mortal
      memory&mdash;perhaps at the expense of his soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For Monsieur to take his injury in silence, to keep it secret, was kind,"
      said the Seigneur. "It is what our Cure here might call bearing his cross
      manfully."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seigneur," said the Cure reproachfully, "Seigneur, it is no subject for
      jest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cure, our tailor here has treated it as a jest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him show his breast, if it's true," said the grocer, who, beneath his
      smirking, was a malignant soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure turned on him sharply. Seldom had any one seen the Cure roused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you, Ba'tiste Maxime, that your base curiosity should be
      satisfied&mdash;you, whose shameless tongue clattered, whose foolish soul
      rejoiced over the scandal? Must we all wear the facts of our lives&mdash;our
      joys, our sorrows, and our sins&mdash;for such eyes as yours to read?
      Bethink you of the evil things that you would hide&mdash;aye, every one
      here!" he added loudly. "Know, all of you, what goodness of heart towards
      a wicked man lay behind the secret these two have kept, that old Margot
      carried to her grave. When you go to your homes, pray for as much human
      kindness in you as a man of no Church or faith can show. For this child"&mdash;he
      turned to Rosalie-"honour her! Go now&mdash;go in peace!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment," said the Seigneur. "I fine Ba'tiste Maxime twenty dollars
      for defamation of character. The money to go for the poor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hear that, ould sand-in-the-sugar!" said Mrs. Flynn. "Will you let me
      kiss ye, darlin'?" she added to Rosalie, and, waddling over, reached out
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie's eyes were wet as she warmly kissed the old Irishwoman, and
      thereupon they entered into a friendship which was without end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur drove the crowd from the shop, and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure came to Charley. "Monsieur," said he, "I have no words. When I
      remember what agonies you suffered in those hours, how bravely you endured
      them&mdash;ah, Monsieur!" he added, with moist eyes, "I shall always feel
      that&mdash;that you are not far from the kingdom of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence fell upon them, for the Cure, the Seigneur, and Rosalie, as they
      looked at Charley, thought of the scar like a red cross on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It touched Charley with a kind of awe. He smiled painfully. "Shall I give
      you proof?" he said, making a motion to undo his waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur!" said the Seigneur reprovingly, and holding out his hand.
      "Monsieur! We are all gentlemen!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII. JO PORTUGAIS TELLS A STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Walking slowly, head bent, eyes unseeing, Charley was on his way to
      Vadrome Mountain, with the knowledge that Jo Portugais had returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunger for companionship was on him: to touch some mind that could
      understand the deep loneliness which had settled on him since that scene
      in the postoffice. It was the loneliness of a new and great separation. He
      had wakened to it to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once before, in the hut on Vadrome Mountain, he had wakened from a grave,
      had been born again. Last night had come still another birth, had come, as
      with Rosalie herself, knowledge, revelation, understanding. To Rosalie the
      new vision had come with a vague pain of heart, without shame, and with a
      wonderful happiness. Pain, shame, knowledge, and a happiness that passed
      suddenly into a despairing sorrow, had come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In finding love he had found conscience, and in finding conscience he was
      on his way to another great discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking to where Jo Portugais' house was set among the pines, Charley
      remembered the day&mdash;he saw the scene in his mind's eye&mdash;when
      Rosalie entered with the letter addressed "To the sick man at the house of
      Jo Portugais, at Vadrome Mountain," and he saw again her clear, unsoiled
      soul in the deep inquiring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you but knew"&mdash;he turned and looked down at the village below&mdash;"if
      you but knew!" he said, as though to all the world. "I have the sign from
      heaven&mdash;I know it now. To-day I wake to know what life means, and I
      see&mdash;Rosalie! I know now&mdash;but how? In taking all she had to
      give. What does she get in return? Nothing&mdash;nothing. Because I love
      her, because the whole world is nothing beside her, nor life, nor twenty
      lives, if I had them to give, I must say to her now: 'Rosalie, it was love
      that brought you to my arms, it is love that says, Thus far and no
      farther. Never again&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;never!' Yesterday I
      could have left her&mdash;died or vanished, without real hurt to her. She
      would have mourned and broken her heart and mended it again; and I should
      have been only a memory&mdash;of mystery, of tenderness. Then, one day she
      would have married, and no sting from my going would have remained. She
      would have had happiness, and I neither shame nor despair.... To-day it is
      all too late. We have drunk too deep-alas! too deep. She cannot marry
      another man, for ghosts will not lie for asking, and what is mine may not
      be another's. She cannot marry me, for what once was mine is mine still by
      ring and by book, and I should always be haunted by a torturing shadow.
      Kathleen has the right of way, not Rosalie. Ah, Rosalie, I dare not wrong
      you further. Yet to marry you, even as things are, if that might be! To
      live on here unrecognised? I am little like my old self, and year after
      year I should grow less and less like Charley Steele.... But, no, it is
      not possible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short in his thoughts, and his lips tightened in bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God in heaven, what an impasse!" he said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden crackling of twigs as a man rose up from a log by the
      wayside ahead of him. It was Jo Portugais, who had seen him coming, and
      had waited for him. He had heard Charley's words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you call me an impasse, M'sieu'?" Charley grasped Portugais' hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened, M'sieu'?" Jo asked anxiously. There was a brief
      silence, and then Charley told him of the events of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know of the mark-here?" he asked, touching his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo nodded. "I saw, when you were ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet you never asked!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I studied it out&mdash;I knew old Louis Trudel. Also, I saw ma'm'selle
      nail the cross to the church door. Two and two together in my mind did it.
      I didn't think Paulette Dubois would tell. I warned her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She quarrelled with mademoiselle. It was revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She might have been less vindictive. She had had good luck herself
      lately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What good luck had she, M'sieu'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley told Jo the story of the Notary, the woman, and the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo made no comment. They relapsed into silence. Arriving at the house,
      they entered. Jo lighted his pipe, and smoked steadily for a time without
      speaking. Buried in thought, Charley stood in the doorway looking down at
      the village. At last he turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where have you been these weeks past, Jo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Quebec first, M'sieu'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley looked curiously at Jo, for there was meaning in his tone. "And
      where last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Montreal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley's face became paler, his hands suddenly clinched, for he read the
      look in Jo's eyes. He knew that Jo had been looking at people and places
      once so familiar; that he had seen&mdash;Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on. Tell me all," he said heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Portugais spoke in English. The foreign language seemed to make the truth
      less naked and staring to himself. He had a hard story to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not to say why I go to Montreal," he began. "But I go. I have my
      ears open; my eyes, she is not close. No one knows me&mdash;I am no
      account of. Every one is forgot the man, Joseph Nadeau, who was try for
      his life. Perhaps it is every one is forget the lawyer who save his neck&mdash;perhaps?
      So I stand by the streetside. I say to a man as I look up at sign-boards,'
      'Where is that writing "M'sieu' Charles Steele," and all the res'?' 'He is
      dead long ago,' say the man to me. 'A good thing too, for he was the very
      devil.' 'I not understan',' I say. 'I tink that M'sieu' Steele is a dam
      smart man back time.' 'He was the smartes' man in the country, that Beauty
      Steele,' the man say. 'He bamboozle the jury hevery time. He cut up bad
      though.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley raised his hand with a nervous gesture of misery and impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Where have you been,' that man say&mdash;'where have you been all these
      times not to know 'bout Charley Steele, hein?' 'In the backwoods,' I say.
      'What bring you here now?' he ask. 'I have a case,' I say. 'What is it?'
      he ask. 'It is a case of a man who is punish for another man,' I say.
      'That's the thing for Charley Steele,' he laugh. 'He was great man to root
      things out. Can't fool Charley Steele, we use to say here. But he die a
      bad death.' 'What was the matter with him?' I say. 'He drink too much, he
      spend too much, he run after a girl at Cote Dorion, and the river-drivers
      do for him one night. They say it was acciden', but is there any green on
      my eye? But he die trump&mdash;jus' like him. He have no fear of devil or
      man,' so the man say. 'But fear of God?' I ask. 'He was hinfidel,' he say.
      'That was behin' all. He was crooked all roun'. He rob the widow and
      horphan?' 'I think he too smart for that,' I speak quick. 'I suppose it
      was the drink,' he say. 'He loose his grip.' 'He was a smart man, an' he
      would make you all sit up, if he come back,' I hanswer. 'If he come back!'
      The man laugh queer at that. 'If he comeback, there would be hell.' 'How
      is that?' I say. 'Look across the street,' he whisper. 'That was his
      wife.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley choked back a cry in his throat. Jo had no intention of cutting
      his story short. He had an end in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I look across the street. There she is&mdash;' Ah, that is a fine woman
      to see! I have never seen but one more finer to look at&mdash;here in
      Chaudiere.' The man say: 'She marry first for money, and break her heart;
      now she marry for love. If Beauty Steele come back-eh! sacra! that would
      be a mess. But he is at the bottom of the St Lawrence&mdash;the courts say
      so, and the Church say so&mdash;and ghosts don't walk here.' 'But if that
      Beauty Steele come back alive, what would happen it?' I speak. 'His wife
      is marry, blockhead!' he say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But the woman is his,' I hanswer. 'Do you think she would go back to a
      thief she never love from the man she love?' he speak back. 'She is not
      marry to the other man,' I say, 'if Beauty Steele is...' 'He is dead as a
      door,' he swear. 'You see that?' he go on, nodding down the street. 'Well,
      that is Billy.' 'Who is Billy?' I ask. 'The brother of her,' he say.
      'Charley, he spoil Billy. Billy, he has not been the same since Charley's
      death-he is so ashame of Charley. When he get drunk he talk of nothing
      else. We all remember that Charley spoil him, and that make us sorry for
      him.' 'Excuse me,' I say. 'I think that Billy is a dam smart man. He is
      smart as Charley Steele.' 'Charley was the smartes' man in the country,'
      he say again. 'I've got his practice now, but this town will never be the
      same without him. Thief or no thief, I wish he is alive here. By the Lord,
      I'd get drunk with him!' He was all right, that man," Jo added finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley's agitation was hidden. His eyes were fixed on Jo intently. "That
      was Larry Rockwell. Go on," he said, in a hard metallic voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see&mdash;her, the next night again. It is in the white stone house on
      the hill. All the windows are open, an' I can hear her to sing. I not know
      that song. It begin, 'Oft in the stilly night'&mdash;like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley stiffened. It was the song Kathleen sang for him the night they
      became engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a good voice-that. I see her face, for there is a candle on the
      piano. I come close and closter to the house. There is big maple-trees&mdash;I
      am well hid. A man is beside her. He lean hover her an' put his hand on
      her shoulder. 'Sing it again, Kat'leen,' he say. 'I cannot to get
      enough.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop!" said Charley, in a strained, harsh voice. "Not yet, M'sieu'," said
      Portugais. "It is good for you to hear what I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Come, Kat'leen!' the man say, an' he blow hout the candle. I hear them
      walk away, an' the door shut behin' them. Then I hear anudder voice&mdash;ah,
      that is a baby&mdash;very young baby!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley quickly got to his feet. "Not another word!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, but there is one word more, M'sieu'," said Jo, standing up and
      facing him firmly. "You must go back. You are not a thief. The woman is
      yours. You throw your life away. What is the man to you&mdash;or the man's
      brat of a child? It is all waiting for you. You mus' go back. You not
      steal the money, but that Billy&mdash;it is that Billy, I know. You can
      forgive your wife, and take her back, or you can say to both, Go! You can
      put heverything right and begin again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anger, wild words, seemed about to break from Charley's lips, but he
      conquered himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old life had been brought back to him with painful acuteness and
      vividness. The streets of the town, the people in the street, Billy, the
      mean scoundrel, who could not leave him alone in the grave of obscurity,
      Kathleen&mdash;Fairing. The voice of the child&mdash;with her voice&mdash;was
      in his ears. A child! If he had had a child, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;He
      stopped short in his thinking, his face all at once flooding with colour.
      For a moment he stood looking out of the window down towards the village.
      He could see the post-office like a toy house among toy houses. At last he
      turned to Jo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never again while I live, speak of this to me: of the past, of going
      back, or of&mdash;of anything else," he said. "I cannot go back. I am dead
      and shamed. Let the dust of forgetfulness come and cover the past. I've
      begun life again here, and here I stay, and see it out. I shall work out
      the problem here." He dropped a hand on the other's shoulder. "Jo," said
      he, "we are both shipwrecks. Let us see how long we can float."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M'sieu', is it worth it?" said Portugais, remembering his confession to
      the Abbe, and seeing the end of it all to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, Jo. Let us wait and see how Fate will play us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or God, M'sieu'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God or Fate&mdash;who knows"
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV. "WHO WAS KATHLEEN?"
    </h2>
    <p>
      The painful incidents of the morning weighed heavily upon Rosalie, and she
      was glad when Madame Dugal came to talk with her father, who was ailing
      and irritable, and when Mrs. Flynn drove her away with a kiss on either
      cheek, saying: "Don't come back, darlin', till there's roses in both
      cheeks, for y'r eyes are 'atin' up yer face!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seen Charley take the path to Vadrome Mountain, and to the Rest of
      the Flax-beaters she betook herself, in the blind hope that, returning, he
      might pass that way. Under the influence of the fresh air and the quiet of
      the woods her spirits rose, her pulse beat faster, though a sense of
      foreboding and sorrow hovered round her. The two-miles walk to her beloved
      retreat seemed a matter of minutes only, so busy were her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind was one luxurious confusion, through which travelled a ghostly
      little sprite, who kept tumbling her thoughts about, sneering, smirking,
      whispering&mdash;"You dare not go to confession&mdash;dare not go to
      confession. You will never be the same again&mdash;never feel the same
      again&mdash;never think the same again; your dreams are done! You can only
      love. And what will this love do for you? What do you expect to happen&mdash;you
      dare not go to confession!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her reply had been the one iteration: "I love him&mdash;I love him&mdash;I
      love him. We shall be together all our lives, till we are old and grey. I
      shall watch him at his work, and listen to his voice. I shall read with
      him and walk with him, and I shall grow to think like him a little&mdash;in
      everything except religion. In everything except that. One day he will
      come to think like me&mdash;to believe in God."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dreamy happiness of these thoughts the colour came to her cheeks,
      the roses of light gathered in her eyes. In her tremulous ardour she
      scarcely realised how time passed, and her reverie deepened as the
      afternoon shadows grew and the sun made to its covert behind the hills.
      She was roused by a man's voice singing, just under the bluff where she
      sat. To her this voice represented the battle-call, the home-call, the
      life call of the universe. The song it sang was known to her. It was as
      old as Rizzio. It had come from old France with Mary, had been merged into
      English words and English music, and had voyaged to New France. There it
      had been sung by lovers in fair vales, on wide rivers, and in deep
      forests:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "What is not mine I may not hold,
            (Ah, hark the hunter's horn!),
          And what is thine may not be sold,
            (My love comes through the corn!);
             And none shall buy
             And none shall sell
             What Love works well?"
</pre>
    <p>
      In the walk back from Vadrome Mountain, a change&mdash;a fleeting change&mdash;had
      passed over Charley's mind and mood. The quiet of the woodland, the song
      of the birds, the tumbling brook, the smell of the rich earth,
      replenishing its strength from the gorgeous falling leaves, had soothed
      him. Thoughts of Rosalie took a new form. Her image possessed him,
      excluding the future, the perils that surrounded them. He had gone through
      so much within the past twenty-four hours that the capacity for suffering
      had almost exhausted itself, and in the reaction endearing thoughts of
      Rosalie had dominion over him. It was the reassertion of primitive man,
      the demands of the first element. The great problem was still in the
      background. The picture of Kathleen and the other man was pushed into the
      distance; thoughts of Billy and his infamy were thrust under foot&mdash;how
      futile to think of them! There was Rosalie to be thought of, the to-day
      and to-morrow of the new life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie was of to-day. How strong and womanly she had been this morning,
      the girl whose life had been bounded by this Chaudiere, with a
      metropolitan convent and hospital as her only glimpses of the busy world.
      She would fit in anywhere&mdash;in the highest places, with her grace, and
      her nobleness of mind, arcadian, passionate and beautiful. There came upon
      him again the feeling of the evening before, when he saw her standing in
      his doorway, the night about them, jealous affection, undying love, in her
      eyes. It quickened his steps imperceptibly. He passed a stream, and
      glanced down into a dark pool involuntarily. It reflected himself clearly.
      He stopped short. "Is this you, Beauty Steele?" he said, and he caught his
      brown beard in his hand. "Beauty Steele had brains and no heart. You have
      heart, and your wits have gone wool-gathering. No matter!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          What is not mine I may not hold,
          (Ah, hark the hunter's horn!)'"
</pre>
    <p>
      he sang, and came quickly along the stream where the flax-beaters worked
      in harvest-time, then up the hill, then&mdash;Rosalie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started to her feet. "I knew you would come&mdash;I knew you would!"
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been waiting here for me?" he asked breathless, taking her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I felt you would come. I made you," she added smiling, and, eagerly
      answering the look in his eyes, threw her arms round his neck. In that
      moment's joy a fresh realisation of their fate came upon him with dire
      force, and a bitter protest went up from his heart, that he and she should
      be sacrificed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the impasse was there, and what could remove it&mdash;what clear the
      way?
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at the girl whose head was buried in happy peace on his
      shoulder. She clung to him, as though in him was everlasting protection
      from the sprite that kept whispering: "You dare not go to confession&mdash;your
      dreams are done&mdash;you can only love." But she had no fear now.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked down at her a swift change passed over him, and, almost for
      the first time since he was a little child, his eyes filled with tears. He
      hastily brushed them away, and drew her down on the seat beside him. He
      was wondering how he should tell her that they must not meet like this,
      that they must be apart. No matter what had happened, no matter what love
      there was, it was better that they should die&mdash;that he should die&mdash;than
      that they should meet like this. There was only one end to secret
      meetings, and discovery was inevitable. Then, with discovery, shame to
      her. For he must either marry her&mdash;how could he marry her?&mdash;or
      die. For him to die would but increase her misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time had passed when it could be of any use. It passed that day in the
      hut on Vadrome Mountain when she said that if he died, she would die with
      him&mdash;"Where you are going you will be alone. There will be no one to
      care for you, no one but me." Last night it passed for ever. She had put
      her life into his hands; henceforth, there could never be a question of
      giving or taking, of withdrawing or advancing, for all was irrevocable,
      sealed with the great seal. Yet she must be saved. But how?
    </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly looked up at him. "I can ask you anything I want now, can't
      I?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything, Rosalie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that when I ask, it is because I want to know what you know, so
      that I may feel as you feel. You know that, don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it when you tell me, wonderful Rosalie." What a revelation it was,
      this transmuting power, which could change mortal dross into the coin of
      immortal wealth!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to ask you," she said, "who was Kathleen?" His blood seemed to go
      cold in his veins, and he sat without answering, shocked and dismayed.
      What could she know of Kathleen?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you tell me?" she asked anxiously yet fearfully. He looked so
      strange that she thought she had offended him. "Please don't mind telling
      me. I should understand everything&mdash;everything. Was it some one you
      loved&mdash;once?" It was hard for her to say it, but she said it bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I never loved any one in all the world, Rosalie&mdash;not till I
      loved you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a happy sigh. "Oh, it is wonderful!" she said. "It is wonderful
      and good! Did you&mdash;did you love me from the very first?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I did, though I didn't know it from the very first," he answered
      slowly. His heart beat hard, for he could not guess how she should know of
      Kathleen. It was absurdly impossible that she should know. "But many have
      loved you!" she said proudly. "They have not shown it," he answered
      grimly; then added quickly, and with aching anxiety: "When did you hear of&mdash;of
      Kathleen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you are such a blind huntsman!" she laughed. "Don't you know where my
      little fox was hiding? Why, in the shop, when you held the note-paper up
      to the light, and looked startled, and bought all the paper we had that
      was water-marked Kathleen. Do you think that was clever of me? I don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it was very clever," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then she-Kathleen&mdash;doesn't really matter?" she asked eagerly. "Of
      course she can't, if you don't love her. But does she love you? Did she
      ever love you?" "Never in her life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So of course it doesn't matter," she rejoined. "Hush!" she added rapidly.
      "I see some one coming in the trees yonder. It may be some one for me.
      Father knows I come here sometimes. Go quickly and hide behind the rocks,
      please. I'll stay and see who it is. Please go&mdash;dearest."
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her, and, keeping out of sight, got to a place of safety a few
      hundred feet away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the new-comer run to Rosalie, speak to her, saw Rosalie half turn
      in his own direction, then go hastily down the hillside with the
      messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is her father!" he exclaimed, and followed at a distance. At the
      village he learned that M. Evanturel had had another seizure.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV. SIX MONTHS GO BY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Spring again&mdash;budding trees and flowing sap; the earth banks removed
      from the houses, and outside windows discarded; the ice tumbling and
      crunching in the river; the dormant farmer raising his head to the energy
      and delight of April.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter had been long and hard. Never had there been severer frost or
      deeper snow, and seldom had big game been so plentiful. In the snug warm
      stables the cattle munched and chewed the cud; the idle, long-haired
      horses grew as spirited in the keen air as in summer they were sluggish
      with hard work; and the farm-hands were abroad in the dark of the early
      mornings with lanterns, to feed the stock and take them out to water,
      singing cheerfully. All morning spread the clamour of the flail and the
      fanning-mill, the swish of the knife through the turnips and the beets,
      and the sound of the saw and the axe, as the youngest man of the family,
      muffled to the nose, sawed the wood into lengths or split the knots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night brought the cutting and stringing of apples, the shelling of the
      Indian corn, the making of rag carpets. On Saturday came the going to
      market with grain, or pork, or beef, or fowls frozen like stones; the
      gossip in the market-place. Then again sounded jingling sleigh-bells as,
      on the return road, the habitant made for home, a glass of white whiskey
      inside him, and black-eyed children in the doorway, swarming like bees at
      the mouth of a hive.
    </p>
    <p>
      This particular winter in Chaudiere had been full of excitement and
      expectation. At Easter-time there was to be the great Passion Play, after
      the manner of that known as The Passion Play of Ober-Ammergau. Not one in
      a hundred habitants had ever heard of Ober-Ammergau, but they had all
      shared in picturesque processions of the Stations of the Cross to some
      calvaire; and many had taken part in dramatic scenes arranged from the
      life of Christ. Drama of a crude kind was deep in them; it showed in
      gesture, speech, and temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the preparations Maximilian Cour was a conspicuous and useful
      official. Gifted with the dramatic temperament to a degree rare in so
      humble a man, he it was who really educated the people of Chaudiere in the
      details of the Passion Play to be produced by the good Catholics of the
      parish and the Indians of the reservation. He had gone to the Cure every
      day, and the Cure had talked with him, and then had sent him to the
      tailor, who had, during the past six months, withdrawn more and more from
      the life about him, practically living with shut door. No one ventured in
      unless on business, or were in need, or wished advice. These he never
      turned empty away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides Portugais, Maximilian Cour was the one man received constantly by
      the tailor. With patience and insight Charley taught the baker, by
      drawings and careful explanations, the outlines of the representation, and
      the baker grew proud of the association, though Charley's face used to
      haunt him in his sleep. Excitable, eager, there was an elemental
      adaptability in the baker, as easily leading to Avernus as to Elysium.
      This appealed to Charley, realising, as he did, that Maximilian Cour was a
      reputable citizen by mere accident. The baker's life had run in a
      sentimental groove of religious duty; that same sentimentality would, in
      other circumstances, have forced him with equal ardour into the broad
      primrose path.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening hours and on Sunday Charley had worked at his drawings for
      the scenery and costumes of the Play, and completed his translation of the
      German text, but there had been days when he could not put pen to paper.
      Life to him now was one aching emptiness&mdash;since that day at the Rest
      of the Flax-beaters Rosalie had been absent. On the very morning after
      their meeting by the river she had gone away with her father to the great
      hospital at Montreal&mdash;not Quebec this time, on the advice of the
      Seigneur&mdash;as the one chance of prolonging his life. There had come
      but one letter from her since that hour when he saw her in the Seigneur's
      coach with her father, moving away in the still autumn air, a piteous
      appeal in her eyes. The good-bye look she gave him then was with him day
      and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had written him one letter, and he had written one in reply, and no
      more. Though he was wholly reckless for himself, for her he was prudent
      now&mdash;there was nothing else to do. To save her&mdash;if he could but
      save her from himself! If he might only put back the clock!
    </p>
    <p>
      In his letter to her he had simply said that it were wiser not to write,
      since the acting postmistress, the Cure's sister, would note the exchange
      of letters, and this would arouse suspicion. He could not see what was
      best to do, what was right to do. To wait seemed the only thing, and his
      one letter ended with the words: Rosalie, my life is lived only in the
      thought of you. There is no hour but I think of you, no moment but you are
      with me. The greatest proof of love that man can give, I will give to you,
      in the hour fate wills&mdash;for us. But now, we must wait&mdash;we must
      wait, Rosalie. Do not write to me, but know that if I could go to you I
      would go; if I could say to you, Come, I would say it. If the giving of my
      life would save you any pain or sorrow, I would give it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting on his bench at work, it seemed to Charley that sometimes she was
      near him, and more than once he turned quickly round as though she were,
      in very truth, standing beside him. He thought of her continually, and
      often with an unbearable pain. He figured her in his mind as pale and
      distressed, and always her eyes had the piteous terror of that last look
      as she went away over the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the weeks had worn on, then the Seigneur, who had been to Montreal,
      came back with the news that Rosalie was looking as beautiful as a
      picture. "Grown a woman in beauty and in stature; comely&mdash;comely as a
      lady in a Watteau picture, my dear messieurs!" he had said to the Cure,
      standing in the tailor's shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Replying, the Cure had said: "She is in good hands, with good people,
      recommended to me by an abbe there; yet I am not wholly happy about her.
      When her trouble comes to her"&mdash;Charley's needle slipped and pierced
      his finger to the bone&mdash;"when her father goes, as he must, I fear,
      there will be no familiar face; she will hear no familiar voice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, there you are wrong, my dear Cure" answered the Seigneur;
      "there'll be a face yonder she likes very well indeed, and a voice she's
      fond of too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley's back was on them at that moment, of which he was glad, for his
      face was haggard with anxiety, and it seemed hours before the Cure said:
      "Whom do you mean, Maurice?" and hours before the Seigneur replied: "Mrs.
      Flynn, of course. I'm sending her tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Flynn had gone, and Charley had, in one sense, been made no happier
      by that, for it seemed to him that Rosalie would rather that strangers'
      eyes were on her than the inquisitively friendly eye of Mary Flynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weeks had grown into months, and no news came&mdash;none save that which
      the Cure let fall, or was brought by the irresponsible Notary, who heard
      all gossip. Only the Cure's scant news were authentic, however, and
      Charley never saw the good priest but he had a secret hope of hearing him
      say that Rosalie was coming back. Yet when she came back, what would, or
      could, he do? There was always the crime for which he or Billy must be
      punished. Concerning this crime his heart was growing harder&mdash;for
      Rosalie's sake. But there was Kathleen&mdash;and Rosalie was now in the
      city where she lived, and they might meet! There was one solution&mdash;if
      Kathleen should die! It sickened him that he could think of that with a
      sense of relief, almost of hope. If Kathleen should die, then he would be
      free to marry Rosalie&mdash;into what? He still could only marry her into
      the peril and menace of the law? Again, even if Kathleen did not stand in
      the way, neither the Cure nor any other priest would marry him to her
      without his antecedents being certified. A Protestant minister would,
      perhaps, but would Rosalie give up her faith? Following him without the
      blessing of the Church, she would trample under foot every dear tradition
      of her life, win the scorn of all of her religion, and destroy her own
      peace; for the faith of her fathers was as the breath of her nostrils.
      What cruelty to her!
    </p>
    <p>
      But was it, after all, even true that he had but to call and she would
      come? In truth it well might be that she had learned to despise him; to
      feel how dastardly he had been to take her love, given in blind
      simplicity, bestowed like the song of the bird upon the listening fields&mdash;to
      take the plenteous fulness of her life, and give nothing in return save
      the empty hand, the hopeless hour, the secret sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could quench his misery. The physical part of him craved without
      ceasing for something to allay his distress. Again and again he fought his
      old enemy with desperate resolve. To fall again, to touch liquor once
      more, was to end all for ever. He fought on tenaciously and gloomily, with
      little of the pride of life, with nothing of the old stubborn self-will,
      but with a new-awakened sense. He had found conscience at last&mdash;and
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The months went by and still M. Evanturel lingered on, and Rosalie did not
      come. The strain became too great at last. In the week preceding Easter,
      when all the parish was busy at Four Mountains, making costumes,
      rehearsing, building, putting up seats, cutting down trees, and erecting
      crosses and calvaries, Charley disclosed to Jo a new intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the earlier part of the winter Jo and he had met two or three times a
      week, but now Jo had come to help him with his work in the shop&mdash;two
      silent, devoted companions. They understood each other, and in that
      understanding were life and death. For never did Jo forget that a year
      from the day he had confessed his sins he meant to give himself up to
      justice. This caused him no sleepless nights. He thought more of Charley
      than of himself, and every month now he went to confession, and every day
      he said his prayers. He was at his prayers when Charley went to tell him
      of his purpose. Charley had often seen Jo on his knees of late, and he had
      wondered, but not with the old pagan mind. "Jo," he said, "I am going away&mdash;to
      Montreal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Montreal!" exclaimed Jo huskily. "You are going back&mdash;to stay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that. I am going&mdash;to see&mdash;Rosalie Evanturel." Jo was
      troubled but not dumfounded. It had slowly crept into his mind that
      Charley loved the girl, though he had no real ground for suspicion. His
      will, however, had been so long the slave of the other man's that he had
      far-off reflections of his thoughts. He made no reply in words, but nodded
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to stay here, Jo. If I don't come back, and&mdash;and she
      does, stand by her, Jo. I can trust you." "You will come back, M'sieu'&mdash;but
      you will come back, then?" Jo asked heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I can, Jo&mdash;if I can," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long after he had gone, Jo wandered up and down among the trees on the
      river-road, up which Charley had disappeared with Jo's dogs and sled. He
      kept shaking his head mournfully.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI. THE FORGOTTEN MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was Easter morning, and the good sunrise of a perfect spring made
      radiant the high hill above the town. Rosy-fingered morn touched with
      magic colour the masts and scattered sails of the ships upon the great
      river, and spires and towers quivered with rainbow light. The city was
      waking cheerfully, though the only active life was in the pealing bells
      and on the deep flowing rivers. The streets were empty yet, save for an
      assiduous priest or the cart of a milkman. Here and there a window opened
      and a drowsy head was thrust into the eager air. These saw a bearded
      countryman with his team of six dogs and his little cart going slowly up
      the street. It was plain the man had come a long distance&mdash;from the
      mountains in the east or south, no doubt, where horses were few, and dogs,
      canoes, and oxen the means of transportation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the man moved slowly through the streets, his dogs still gallantly full
      of life after their hard journey, he did not stare about him after the
      manner of countrymen. His movements had intelligence and freedom. He was
      an unusual figure for a woodsman or river-man&mdash;he did not wear
      ear-rings or a waist-sash as did the river-men, and he did not turn in his
      toes like a woodsman. Yet he was plainly a man from the far mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man with the dogs did not heed the few curious looks turned his way,
      but held his head down as though walking in familiar places. Now and then
      he spoke to his dogs, and once he stopped before a newspaper office, which
      had a placard bearing these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coming Passion Play In the Chaudiere Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at it mechanically, for, though he was concerned in the Passion
      Play and the Chaudiere Valley, it was an abstraction to him at this
      moment. His mind was absorbed by other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he looked neither to right nor to left, he was deeply affected by
      all round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he came to a certain street, where he and his dogs travelled more
      quickly. It opened into a square, where bells were booming in the steeple
      of a church. Shops and offices in the street were shut, but a saloon-door
      was open, and over the doorway was the legend: Jean Jolicoeur, Licensed to
      sell Wine, Beer, and other Spirituous and Fermented Liquors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly opposite was a lawyer's office, with a new-painted sign. It had
      once read, in plain black letters, Charles Steele, Barrister, etc.; now it
      read, in gold letters and many flourishes of the sign-painter's art,
      Rockwell and Tremblay, Barristers, Attorneys, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the man looked up with trouble in his eyes. He could see dimly the
      desk and the window beside which he had sat for so many years, and on the
      wall a map of the city glowed with the incoming sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved on, passing the saloon with the open door. The landlord, in his
      shirt-sleeves, was standing in the doorway. He nodded, then came out to
      the edge of the board-walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come a long way, M'sieu'?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four days' journey," answered the man gruffly through his beard, looking
      the landlord in the eyes. If this landlord, who in the past had seen him
      so often and so closely, did not recognise him, surely no one else would.
      It was, however, a curious recurrence of habit that, as he looked at the
      landlord, he instinctively felt for his eye-glass, which he had discarded
      when he left Chaudiere. For an instant there was an involuntary arrest of
      Jean Jolicoeur's look, as though memory had been roused, but this swiftly
      passed, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine dogs, them! We never get that kind hereabouts now, M'sieu'. Ever
      been to the city before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never been far from home before," answered the Forgotten Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd better keep your eyes open, my friend, though you've got a sharp
      pair in your head&mdash;sharp as Beauty Steele's almost. There's rascals
      in the river-side drinking-places that don't let the left hand know what
      the right does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dogs and I never trust anybody," said the Forgotten Man, as one of the
      dogs snarled at the landlord's touch. "So I can take care of myself, even
      if I haven't eyes as sharp as Beauty Steele's, whoever he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord laughed. "Beauty's only skin-deep, they say. Charley Steele
      was a lawyer; his office was over there"&mdash;he pointed across the
      street. "He went wrong. He come here too often&mdash;that wasn't my fault.
      He had an eye like a hawk, and you couldn't read it. Now I can read your
      eye like a book. There's a bit of spring in 'em, M'sieu'. His eyes were
      hard winter-ice five feet deep and no fishing under&mdash;froze to the
      bed. He had a tongue like a cross-cut saw. He's at the bottom of the St.
      Lawrence, leaving a bad job behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have a drink&mdash;hein?" He jerked a finger backwards to the saloon
      door. "It's Sunday, but stolen waters are sweet, sure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Forgotten Man shook his head. "I don't drink, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It'd do you good. You're dead beat. You've been travelling hard&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've come a long way, and travelled all night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going back to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley nodded&mdash;he glanced involuntarily at the sign across the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Jolicoeur saw the look. "Lawyer's business, p'r'aps?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A lawyer's business&mdash;yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, if Charley Steele was here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have as good a lawyer as&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord laughed scornfully. "They're not made. He'd legislate the
      devil out of the Pit. Where are you going to stay, M'sieu'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somewhere cheap&mdash;along the river," answered the Forgotten Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolicoeur's good-natured face became serious. "I'll tell you a place&mdash;it's
      honest. It's the next street, a few hundred yards down, on the left.
      There's a wooden fish over the door. It's called The Black Bass&mdash;that
      hotel. Say I sent you. Good luck to you, countryman! Ah, la; la, there's
      the second bell&mdash;I must be getting to Mass!" With a nod he turned and
      went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Forgotten Man passed slowly up the street, into the side street, and
      followed it till he came to The Black Bass, and turned into the small
      stable-yard. A stable-man was stirring. He at once put his dogs into a
      little pen set apart for them, saw them fed from the kitchen, and,
      betaking himself to a little room behind the bar of the hotel, ordered
      breakfast. The place was empty, save for the servant&mdash;the household
      were at Mass. He looked round the room abstractedly. He was thinking of a
      crippled man in a hospital, of a girl from a village in the Chaudiere
      Valley. He thought with a shiver of a white house on the hill. He thought
      of himself as he had never done before in his life. Passing along the
      street, he had realised that he had no moral claim upon anything or
      anybody within these precincts of his past life. The place was a tomb to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat in the little back parlour of The Black Bass, eating his frugal
      breakfast of eggs and bread and milk, the meaning of it all slowly dawned
      upon him. Through his intellect he had known something of humanity, but he
      had never known men. He had thought of men in the mass, and despised them
      because of their multitudinous duplication, and their typical weaknesses;
      but he had never known one man or one woman from the subtler, surer
      divination of the heart. His intellect had made servants and lures of his
      emotions and his heart, for even his every case in court had been won by
      easy and selfish command of all those feelings in mankind which make
      possible personal understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this little back parlour it came to him with sudden force how, long
      ago, he had cut himself off from any claim upon his fellows&mdash;not only
      by his conduct, but by his merciless inhuman intelligence working upon the
      merciful human life about him. He never remembered to have had any real
      feeling till on that day with Kathleen&mdash;the day he died. The bitter
      complaint of a woman he had wronged cruelly, by having married her, had
      wrung from him his own first wail of life, in the one cry "Kathleen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat eating his simple meal his pulses were beating painfully. Every
      nerve in his body seemed to pluck at the angry flesh. There flashed across
      his mind in sympathetic sensation a picture. It was the axe-factory on the
      river, before which he used to stand as a boy, and watch the men naked to
      the waist, with huge hairy arms and streaming faces, toiling in the red
      glare, the trip-hammers endlessly pounding upon the glowing metal. In old
      days it had suggested pictures of gods and demi-gods toiling in the
      workshops of the primeval world. So the whole machinery of being seemed to
      be toiling in the light of an awakened conscience, to the making of a man.
      It seemed to him that all his life was being crowded into these hours. His
      past was here&mdash;its posing, its folly, its pitiful uselessness, and
      its shame. Kathleen and Billy were here, with all the problems that
      involved them. Rosalie was here, with the great, the last problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing matters but that&mdash;but Rosalie," he said to himself as he
      turned to look out of the window at the wrangling dogs gnawing bones.
      "Here she is in the midst of all I once knew, and I know that I am no more
      a part of it than she is. She and Kathleen may have met face to face in
      these streets&mdash;who can tell! The world is large, but there's a sort
      of whipper-in of Fate, who drives the people wearing the same livery into
      one corner in the end. If they met"&mdash;he rose and walked hastily up
      and down&mdash;"what then? I have a feeling that Rosalie would recognise
      her as plainly as though the word Kathleen were stitched on her breast."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a clock on the wall. He looked at it. "It will not be safe to go
      out until evening. Then I can go to the hospital, and watch her coming
      out." He realised with satisfaction that many people coming from Mass must
      pass the inn. There was a chance of his seeing Rosalie, if she had gone to
      early Mass. This street lay in her way from the hospital. "One look&mdash;ah,
      one look!" For this one look he had come. For this, and to secure that
      which would save Rosalie from want always, if anything should happen to
      him. This too had been greatly on his mind. There was a way to give her
      what was his very own, which would rob no one and serve her well indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at his face in the mirror over the mantel, he said to himself
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might have had ten thousand friends, yet I have a thousand enemies, who
      grin at the memory of the drunken fop down among the eels and the
      cat-fish. Every chance was with me then. I come back here, and&mdash;and
      Jolicoeur tells me the brutal truth. But if I had had ambition"&mdash;a
      wave of the feeling of the old life passed over him&mdash;"if I had had
      ambition as I was then, I should have been a monster. It was all so paltry
      that, in sheer disgust, I should have kicked every ladder down that helped
      me up. I should have sacrificed everything to myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short and stared, for, in the mirror, he saw a girl passing
      through the stable-yard towards the quarrelling dogs in the kennel. He
      clapped his hand to his mouth to stop a cry. It was Rosalie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not turn round but looked at her in the mirror, as though it were
      the last look he might give on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could hear her voice speaking to the dogs: "Ah, my friends, ah, my
      dears! I know you every one. Jo Portugais is here. I know your bark, you,
      Harpy, and you, Lazybones, and you, Cloud and London! I know you every
      one. I heard you as I came from Mass, beauty dears. Ah, you know me,
      sweethearts? Ah, God bless you for coming! You have come to bring us home;
      you have come to fetch us home&mdash;father and me." The paws of one of
      the dogs was on her shoulder, and his nose was in her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley heard her words, for the window was open, and he listened and
      watched now with an infinite relief in his look. Her face was half turned
      towards him. It was pale-very pale and sad. It was Rosalie as of old&mdash;thank
      God, as of old!&mdash;but more beautiful in the touching sadness, the
      far-off longing, of her look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must go and see your master," she said to the dogs. "Down&mdash;down,
      Lazybones!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time to lose&mdash;he must not meet her ere. He went into the
      outer hall hastily. The servant was passing through. "If any one asks for
      Jo Portugais," he said, "say that I'll be back to-morrow morning&mdash;I'm
      going across the river to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, M'sieu'," said the girl, and smiled because of the piece of
      silver he put in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he heard the side door open he stepped through the front doorway into
      the street, and disappeared round a corner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII. ONE WAS TAKEN AND THE OTHER LEFT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rosalie carried to the hospital that afternoon a lighter heart than she
      had known for many a day. The sight of Jo Portugais' dogs had roused her
      out of the apathy which had been growing on her in this patient but
      hopeless watching beside her father. She had always a smile and a cheerful
      word for the poor man. A settled sorrow hung upon her face, however,
      taking away its colour, but giving it a sweet gravity which made her slave
      more than one young doctor of the hospital, for whom, however, she showed
      no more than a friendly frankness, free from self-consciousness. For hours
      she would sit in reverie beside her sleeping father, her heart "over the
      water to Charley." As in a trance, she could see him sitting at his bench,
      bent over his work, now and again lifting up his head to look across to
      the post-office, where another hand than hers sorted letters now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day her father weakened and faded away. All that was possible to
      medical skill had been done. As the money left by her mother dwindled, she
      had no anxiety, for she knew that the life she so tenderly cherished would
      not outlast the gold which lengthened out the tenuous chain of being. This
      last illness of her father's had been the salvation of her mind, the
      saving of her health. Maybe it had been the saving of her soul; for at
      times a curious contempt of life came upon her&mdash;she who had loved it
      so eagerly and fully. There descended on her then the bitter conviction
      that never again would she see the man she loved. Then not even Mrs. Flynn
      could call back "the fun o' the world" to her step and her tongue and her
      eye. At first there had been a timid shrinking, but soon her father and
      herself were brighter and better for the old Irishwoman's presence, and
      she began to take comfort in Mrs. Flynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Flynn gave hopefulness to whatever life she touched, and Rosalie,
      buoyant and hopeful enough by nature, responded to the living warmth and
      the religion of life in the Irishwoman's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis worth the doin', ivery bit of it, darlin', the bither an' the swate,
      the hard an' the aisy, the rough an' the smooth, the good an' the bad,"
      said Mrs. Flynn to her this very Easter morning. "Even the avil is worth
      doin', if so be 'twas not mint, an' the good is in yer heart in the ind,
      an' ye do be turnip' to the Almoighty, repentin' an' glad to be aloive:
      provin' to Him 'twas worth while makin' the world an' you, to want, an'
      worry, an' work, an' play, an' pick the flowers, an' bleed o' the thorns,
      an' dhrink the sun, an' ate the dust, an' be lovin' all the way! Ah,
      that's it, darlin'," persisted Mrs. Flynn, "'tis lovin' all the way makes
      it aisier. There's manny kinds o' love. There's lad an' lass, there's maid
      an' man. An' that last is spring, an' all the birds singin', an' shtorms
      now an' thin, an' siparations, an' misthrust, an' God in hivin bein' that
      aisy wid ye for bein' fools an' children, an' bringin' ye thegither in the
      ind, if so be ye do be lovin' as man an' maid should love, wid all yer
      heart. Thin there's the love o' man an' wife. Shure, that's the love that
      lasts, if it shtarts right. Shure, it doesn't always shtart wid the sun
      shinin.' 'Will ye marry me?' says Teddy Flynn to me. 'I will,' says I.
      'Then I'll come back from Canaday to futch ye,' says he, wid a tear in his
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'For what's a man in ould Ireland that has a head for annything but
      puttaties! There's land free in Canaday, an' I'm goin' to make a home for
      ye, Mary,' says he, wavin' a piece of paper in the air. 'Are ye, thin?'
      says I. He goes away that night, an' the next mornin' I have a lether from
      him, sayin' he's shtartin' that day for Canaday. He hadn't the heart to
      tell me to me face. Fwaht do I do thin? I begs, borrers, an' stales, an' I
      reached that ship wan minnit before she sailed. There was no praste
      aboord, but we was married six weeks afther at Quebec. And thegither we
      lived wid ups an' downs&mdash;but no ups an' downs to the love of us for
      twenty years, blessed be God for all His mercies!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie had listened with eyes that hungrily watched every expression,
      ears that weighed eagerly every inflection; for she was hearing the story
      of another's love, and it did not seem strange to her that a woman, old,
      red-faced, and fat, should be telling it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there were times when she wept till she was exhausted; when all her
      girlhood was drowned in the overflow of her eyes; when there was a sense
      of irrevocable loss upon her. Then it was, in her fear of soul and pitiful
      loneliness, that her lover&mdash;the man she would have died for&mdash;seemed
      to have deserted her. Then it was that a sudden hatred against him rose up
      in her&mdash;to be swept away as swiftly as it came by the memory of his
      broken tale of love, his passionate words: "I have never loved any one but
      you in all my life, Rosalie." And also, there was that letter from
      Chaudiere, which said that in the hour when the greatest proof of his love
      must be given he would give it. Reading the letter again, hatred, doubt,
      even sorrow, passed from her, and her imagination pictured the hour when,
      disguise and secrecy ended, he would step forward before all the world and
      say: "I take Rosalie Evanturel to be my wife." Despite the gusts of
      emotion that swayed her at times, in the deepest part of her being she
      trusted him completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached the hospital this Sunday afternoon her step was quick,
      her smile bright&mdash;though she had not been to confession as was her
      duty on Easter day. The impulse towards it had been great, but her secret
      was not her own, and the passionate desire to give relief to her full
      heart was overborne by thought of the man. Her soul was her own, but this
      secret of their love was his as well as hers. She knew that she was the
      only just judge between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after she entered the ward, the chief surgeon said that all that
      could be done for her father had now been done, and that as M. Evanturel
      constantly asked to be taken back to Chaudiere (he never said to die,
      though they knew what was in his mind), he might now make the journey,
      partly by river, partly by land. It seemed to the delighted and excited
      Rosalie that Jo Portugais had been sent to her as a surprise, and that his
      team of dogs was to take her father back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat by her father's bed this beautiful, wonderful Sunday afternoon,
      and talked cheerfully, and laughed a little, and told M. Evanturel of the
      dogs, and together they looked out of the window to the far-off hills, in
      their golden purple, beyond which, in the valley of the Chaudiere, was
      their little home. With her father's hand in hers the girl dreamed dreams
      again, and it seemed to her that she was the very Rosalie Evanturel of
      old, whose thoughts were bounded by a river and a hill, a post-office and
      a church, a catechism and a few score of books. Here in the crowded city
      she had come to be a woman who, bitterly shaken in soul, knew life's
      sufferings; who had, during the past few months, read with avidity
      history, poetry, romance, fiction, and the drama, English and French; for
      in every one she found something that said: "You have felt that." In these
      long months she had learned more than she had known or learned in all her
      previous life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sat looking out into the eastern sky she became conscious of
      voices, and of a group of people who came slowly down the ward, sometimes
      speaking to the sick and crippled. It was not a general visitors' day, but
      one reserved for the few to come and say a kindly word to the suffering,
      to bring some flowers and distribute books. Rosalie had always been absent
      at this hour before, for she shrank from strangers; but to-day she had
      stayed on unthinking. It mattered nothing to her who came and went. Her
      heart was over the hills, and the only tie she had here was with this poor
      cripple whose hand she held. If she did not resent the visit of these
      kindly strangers, she resolutely held herself apart from the object of
      their visit with a sense of distance and cold dignity. If she had given
      Charley something of herself, she had in turn taken something from him,
      something unlike her old self, delicately non-intime. Knowledge of life
      had rationalised her emotions to a definite degree, had given her the
      pride of self-repression. She had had need of it in these surroundings,
      where her beauty drew not a little dangerous attention, which she had held
      at arm's-length&mdash;her great love for one man made her invulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as the visitors came near, she did not turn towards them, but still
      sat, her chin on her hand, looking out across the hills, in resolute
      abstraction. She felt her father's fingers press hers, as if to draw her
      attention, for he, weak man, was ever ready to open his hand and heart to
      any friendly soul. She took no notice, but held his hand firmly, as though
      to say that she had no wish to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious now that they were beside her father's bed. She hoped
      that they would pass. But no, the feet stopped, there was whispering, and
      then she heard a voice say, "Rather rude!" then another, "Not wanted,
      that's plain!"&mdash;the first a woman's, the second a man's. Then another
      voice, clear and cold, and well modulated, said to her father: "They tell
      me you have been here a long time, and have had much pain. You will be
      glad to go, I am sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the voice startled her. Some familiar sound or inflection
      struck upon her ear with a far-off note, some lost tone she knew. Of what,
      of whom, did this voice remind her? She turned round quickly and caught
      two cold blue eyes looking at her. The face was older than her own,
      handsome and still, and happy in a placid sort of way. Few gusts of
      passion or of pain had passed across that face. The figure was shapely to
      the newest fashion, the bonnet was perfect, the hand which held two books
      was prettily gloved. Polite charity was written in her manner and
      consecrated every motion. On the instant, Rosalie resented this fine
      epitome of convention, this dutiful charity-monger, herself the centre of
      an admiring quartet. She saw the whispering, she noted the well-bred
      disguise of interest, and she met the visitor's gaze with cold courtesy.
      The other read the look in her face, and a slightly pacifying smile
      gathered at her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are glad to hear that your father is better. He has been ill a long
      time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie started again, for the voice perplexed her&mdash;rather, not the
      voice, but the inflection, the deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bowed, and set her lips, but, chancing to glance at her father, she
      saw that he was troubled by her manner. Flashing a look of love at him,
      she adjusted the pillow under his head, and said to her questioner in a
      low voice: "He is better now, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Encouraged, the other rejoined: "May I leave one or two books for him to
      read&mdash;or for you to read to him?" Then added hastily, for she saw a
      curious look in Rosalie's eyes: "We can have mutual friends in books,
      though we cannot be friends with each other. Books are the go-betweens of
      humanity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie's heart leapt, she flushed, then grew slightly pale, for it was
      not tone or inflection alone that disturbed her now, but words themselves.
      A voice from over the hills seemed to say these things to her. A haunting
      voice from over the hills had said them to her&mdash;these very words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends need no go-betweens," she said quietly, "and enemies should not
      use them."
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard a voice say, "By Jove!" in a tone of surprise, as though it were
      wonderful the girl from Chaudiere should have her wits about her. So
      Rosalie interpreted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you many friends here?" asked the cold voice, meant to be kindly and
      pacific. It was schooled to composure, because it gave advantage in life's
      intercourse, not from any inner urbanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some need many friends, some but a few. I come from a country where one
      only needs a few."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is your country, I wonder?" said the cold echo of another voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley had passed out of Kathleen's life&mdash;he was dead to her, his
      memory scorned and buried. She loved the man to whom she supposed she was
      married; she was only too glad to let the dust of death and time cover
      every trace of Charley from her gaze; she would have rooted out every
      particle of association: yet his influence on her had been so great that
      she had unconsciously absorbed some of his idiosyncrasies&mdash;in the
      tone of his voice, in his manner of speaking. To-day she had even repeated
      phrases he had used.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beyond the hills," said Rosalie, turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not strange?" said the voice. "That is the title of one of the
      books I have just brought&mdash;'Beyond the Hills'. It is by an English
      writer. This other book is French. May I leave them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie inclined her head. It would make her own position less dignified
      if she refused them. "Books are always welcome to my father," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant's pause, as though the fashionable lady would offer
      her hand; but their eyes met, and they only bowed. The lady moved on with
      a smile, leaving a perfume of heliotrope behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is your country, I wonder?"&mdash;the voice of the lady rang in
      Rosalie's ears. As she sat at the window again, long after the visitors
      had disappeared, the words, "I wonder&mdash;I wonder&mdash;I wonder!" kept
      beating in her brain. It was absurd that this woman should remind her of
      the tailor of Chaudiere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she was roused by her father's voice. "This is beautiful&mdash;ah,
      but beautiful, Rosalie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned towards him. He was reading the book in his hand&mdash;'Beyond
      the Hills'. "Listen," he said, and he read, in English: "'Compensation is
      the other name for God. How often is it that those whom disease or
      accident has robbed of active life find greater inner rejoicing and a
      larger spiritual itinerary! It would seem that withdrawal from the ruder
      activities gives a clearer seeing. Also for these, so often, is granted a
      greater love, which comes of the consecration of other lives to theirs.
      And these too have their reward, for they are less encompassed by the
      vanities of the world, having the joy of self-sacrifice.'" He looked at
      Rosalie with an unnatural brightness in his eyes, and she smiled at him
      now and stroked his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has been all compensation to me," he said, after a moment. "You have
      been a good daughter to me, Rosalie."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head and smiled. "Good fathers think they have good
      daughters," she answered, choking back a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the book and let it lie upon the coverlet. "I will sleep now,"
      he said, and turned on his side. She arranged his pillow, and adjusted the
      bedclothes to his comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night," he said, as, with a faint hand, he drew her head down and
      kissed her. "Good girl! Goodnight!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She patted his hand. "It is not night yet, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was already half asleep. "Good-night!" he said again, and fell into a
      deep sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down by the window, in her hand the book he had laid down. A
      hundred thoughts were busy in her brain&mdash;of her father; of the woman
      who had just left; of her lover over the hills. The woman's voice came to
      her again&mdash;a far-off mockery. She opened the book mechanically and
      turned over the pages. Presently her eyes were riveted to a page. On it
      was written the word Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she sat transfixed. The word Kathleen and the haunting voice
      became one, and her mind ran back to the day when she had said to Charley:
      "Who is Kathleen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet. What should she do? Follow the woman? Find out who
      and what she was? Go to the young surgeon who had accompanied them, ask
      him who she was, and so learn the clue to the mystery concerning her
      lover?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of her confusion she became sharply conscious of two things:
      the approach of Mrs. Flynn, and her father's heavy breathing. Dropping the
      book, she leaned over her father's bed and looked closely at him. Then she
      turned to the frightened and anxious Mrs. Flynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go for the priest," she said. "He is dying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll send some one. I'm stayin' here by you, darlin'," said the old
      woman, and hurried to the room of the young surgeon for a messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sun went down, the cripple went out upon a long journey alone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII. "WHERE THE TREE OF LIFE IS BLOOMING&mdash;"
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Charley walked the bank of the great river by the city where his old
      life lay dead, he struggled with the new life which&mdash;long or short&mdash;must
      henceforth belong to the village of the woman he loved.... But as he
      fought with himself in the long night-watch it was borne in upon him that
      though he had been shown the Promised Land, he might never find there a
      habitation and a home. The hymn he had mockingly sung the night he had
      been done to death at the Cote Dorion sang in his senses now, an
      ever-present mockery:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "On the other side of Jordan,
        In the sweet fields of Eden,
        Where the tree of life is blooming,
          There is rest for you.
        There is rest for the weary,
        There is rest for the weary,
        There is rest for the weary,
          There is rest for you."
</pre>
    <p>
      In the uttermost corner of his intelligence he felt with sure prescience
      that, however befalling, the end of all was not far off. In the exercise
      of new faculties, which had more to do with the soul than with reason, he
      now believed what he could not see, and recognised what was not proved.
      Labour of the hand, trouble, sorrow, and perplexity, charity and humanity,
      had cleared and simplified his life, had sweetened his intelligence, and
      taken the place of ambition. He saw life now through the lens of personal
      duty, which required that the thing nearest to one's hand should be done
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as foreboding pressed upon him there came the thought of what should
      come after&mdash;to Rosalie. His thoughts took a practical form&mdash;her
      good was uppermost in his mind. All Rosalie had to live on was her salary
      as postmistress, for it was in every one's knowledge that the little else
      she had was being sacrificed to her father's illness. Suppose, then, that
      through illness or accident she lost her position, what could she do? He
      might leave her what he had&mdash;but what had he? Enough to keep her for
      a year or two&mdash;no more. All his earnings had gone to the poor and the
      suffering of Chaudiere.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one way. It had suggested itself to him so often in Chaudiere,
      and had been one of the two reasons for bringing him here. There were his
      dead mother's pearls and one thousand dollars in notes behind a secret
      panel in the white house on the hill, in this very city where he was. The
      pearls were worth over ten thousand dollars&mdash;in all, there would be
      eleven thousand, enough to secure Rosalie from poverty. What should
      Kathleen do with his mother's pearls, even if they were found by her? What
      should she do with his money did she not loathe his memory? Had not all
      his debts been paid? These pearls and this money were all his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to get them. To go now to the white house on the hill; to face that
      old life even for an hour, a knocking at the door of a haunted house&mdash;he
      shrank from the thought. He would have to enter the place like a thief in
      the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet for Rosalie he must take the risk&mdash;he must go.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIX. THE OPEN GATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a still night, and the moon, delicately bright, gave forth that
      radiance which makes spiritual to the eye the coarsest thing. Inside the
      white house on the hill all was dark. Sleep had settled on it long before
      midnight, for, on the morrow, its master and mistress hoped to make a
      journey to the valley of the Chaudiere, where the Passion Play was being
      performed by habitants and Indians. The desire to see the play had become
      an infatuation in the minds of the two, eager for some interest to relieve
      the monotony of a happy life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as all slept, a figure in the dress of a habitant moved through the
      passages of the house stealthily, yet with an assurance unusual in the
      thief or housebreaker. In the darkest passages his step was sure, and his
      hand fastened on latch or door-knob with perfect precision. He came at
      last into a large hallway flooded by the moon, pale, watchful, his beard
      frosted by the light. In the stillness of his tread and the composed
      sorrow of his face he seemed like one long dead who "revisits the glimpses
      of the moon."
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he entered a room the door of which stood wide open. In this room
      had been begotten, or had had exercise, whatever of him was worth
      approving in the days before he died. It was a place of books and statues
      and tapestry, and the dark oak was nobly smutched of Time. This sombre
      oaken wall had been handed down through four generations from the man's
      great-grandfather: the breath of generations had steeped it in human
      association.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering, he turned for an instant with clinched hands to look at another
      door across the hall. Behind that door were two people who despised his
      memory, who conspired to forget his very name. This house was the woman's,
      for he had given it to her the day he died. But that she could live there
      with all the old associations, with memories that, however bitter, however
      shaming, had a sort of sacredness, struck into his soul with a harrowing
      pain. There she was whom he had spared&mdash;himself; whose happiness had
      lain in his hands, and he had given it to her. Yet her very existence
      robbed himself of happiness, and made sorrowful a life dearer than his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen lay asleep in that room&mdash;he fancied he could hear her
      breathing; and, by the hospital on the hill, up beyond the point of pines,
      in a little cottage which he could see from the great window, lay Rosalie
      with sleepless eyes and wan cheeks, longing for morning and the stir of
      life to help her to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Rosalie he had come to this house once more. For her sake he was
      revisiting this torture-chamber, from which he knew he must go again,
      blanched and shaken, as a man goes from a tomb where his dead lie
      unforgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shut his teeth, went swiftly across the room, and beside a great carved
      oak table touched a hidden spring in the side of it. The spring snapped;
      the panel creaked a little and drew back. It seemed to him that the noise
      he made must be heard in every part of the house, so sensitive was his
      ear, so deep was the silence on which the sounds had broken. He turned
      round to the doorway to listen before he put his hand within the secret
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sound. He turned his attention to the table. Drawing forth
      two packets with a gasp of relief, he put them in his pocket, and, with
      extreme care, proceeded to close the panel. By rubbing the edges of the
      wood with grease from a candle on the table, he was able to readjust the
      panel in silence. But, as the spring came home, he became suddenly
      conscious of a presence in the room. A shiver passed through him. He
      turned round-softly, quickly. He was in the shadow and near great
      window-curtains, and his fingers instinctively clutched them as he saw a
      figure in white at the door of the room. Slowly, strangely deliberate, the
      figure moved further into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley's breath stopped. He felt his face flush, and a strange weakness
      came on him. There before him stood Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in her night-gown, and she stood still, as though listening; yet,
      as Charley looked closer, he realised that it was an unconscious, passive
      listening, and that she did not know he was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind only was listening. She was asleep. Was it possible that his very
      presence in the house had touched some old note of memory, which,
      automatically responding, had carried her from her bed in this
      somnambulistic trance? That subtle telegraphy between our subconscious
      selves which we cannot reduce to a law, yet alarming us at times,
      announced to Kathleen's mind, independent of the waking senses, the
      presence once familiar to this house for so many years. In her sleep she
      had involuntarily responded to the call of Charley's approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, in the past, the night her uncle died, she had walked in her sleep,
      and the memory of this flashed upon Charley now. Silently he came closer
      to her. The moonlight shone on her face. He could see plainly she was
      asleep. His position was painful and perilous. If she waked, the shock to
      herself would be great; if she waked and saw him, what disaster might not
      occur!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he had no agitation now, only clearness of mind and a curious sense of
      confusion that he should see her en dishabille&mdash;the old fastidious
      sense mingling with the feeling that she was now a stranger to him, and
      that, waking, she would fly embarrassed from his presence, as he was ready
      to fly from hers. He was about to steal to the door and escape before she
      waked, but she turned round, moved through the doorway, and glided down
      the hall. He followed silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved to the staircase, then slowly down it, and through a passage to
      a morning-room, where, opening a pair of French windows, she passed out
      onto the lawn. He followed, not more than a dozen paces behind her. His
      safety lay in getting outside, where he could easily hide among the
      bushes, should someone else appear and an alarm be raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the lawn swiftly, a white, ghostlike figure. In the middle of
      the lawn she stopped short once as if in doubt what to do&mdash;as a
      thought-reader pauses in his search for the mental scent again, ere he
      rushes upon the object of his search with the certainty of instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she moved on, going directly towards a gate that opened out on
      the cliff above the river. In Charley's day this gate had been often used,
      for it gave upon four steep wooden steps leading to a narrow shelf of rock
      below. From the edge of this cliff a rope-ladder dropped fifty feet to the
      river. For years he had used this rope-ladder to get down to his boat, and
      often, when they were first married, Kathleen used to come and watch him
      descend, and sometimes, just at the very first, would descend also. As he
      stole into the grounds this evening he had noticed, however, that the
      rope-ladder was gone, and that new steps were being built. He had also
      mechanically observed that the gate was open.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant he watched her slowly moving towards the gate. At first he
      did not realise the situation. Suddenly her danger flashed upon him.
      Passing through the gateway, she must fall over the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her life was in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could rush forward swiftly and close the gate, then, raising an alarm,
      get away before he was seen; or&mdash;he could escape now.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had he to do with her? A weird, painful suggestion crept into his
      brain: he was not responsible for her, and he was responsible for a woman
      up there by the hospital, whose home was the valley of the Chaudiere!
    </p>
    <p>
      If Kathleen were gone, what barrier would there be between him and
      Rosalie? What had he to do with this strange disposition of events?
      Kathleen was never absent from her church twice on Sundays; she was
      devoted to work of all sorts for the church on week-days&mdash;where was
      her intervening personal Providence? If Providence permitted her to die?&mdash;well,
      she had had two years of happiness with the man she loved, at some expense
      to himself&mdash;was it not fair that Rosalie should have her share? Had
      he the right to call upon Rosalie for constant self-sacrifice, when, by
      shutting his eyes now, by being dead to Kathleen and her need, as he was
      dead to the world he once knew, the way would be clear to marry Rosalie?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead&mdash;he was dead to the world and to Kathleen! Should his ghost
      interpose between her and the death now within two-score feet of her? Who
      could know? It was grim, it was awful, but was it not a wild kind of
      justice? Who could blame? It was the old Charley Steele, the Charley
      Steele of the court-room, who argued back humanity and the inherent
      rightness of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was only a moment's pause. The thoughts flashed by like the
      lightning impressions of a dream, and a voice said in his ear, the voice
      of the new Charley with a conscience:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Save her&mdash;save her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as he was conscious of another presence on the lawn, he rushed
      forward noiselessly. Stealing between Kathleen and the gate-she was within
      five feet of it he closed and locked it. Then, with a quick glance at her
      sleeping face-it was engraven on his memory ever after like a dead face in
      a coffin&mdash;he ran along the fence among the shrubbery. A man not fifty
      feet away called to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush&mdash;she is asleep!" Charley whispered, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Fairing himself who saw this deed which saved Kathleen's life.
      Awaking, and not finding her, he had glanced towards the window, and had
      seen her on the lawn. He had rushed down to her, in time to see her saved
      by a strange bearded man in habitant dress. His one glance at the man's
      face, as it turned towards him, produced an extraordinary effect upon his
      mind, not soon to be dispelled&mdash;a haunting, ghostlike apparition,
      which kept reminding him of something or somebody, he could not tell what
      or whom. The whispering voice and the breathless words, "Hush&mdash;she is
      asleep!" repeated themselves over and over again in his brain, as, taking
      Kathleen's hand, he led her, unresisting, and still sleeping, back to her
      room. In agitated thankfulness he resolved not to speak of the event to
      Kathleen, or to any one else, lest it should come to her ears and frighten
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would, however, keep a sharp lookout for the man who had saved her
      life, and would reward him duly. The face of the bearded habitant came
      between him and his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile this disturber of a woman's dreams and a man's sleep was
      hurrying to an inn in the town by the waterside, where he met another
      habitant with a team of dogs&mdash;Jo Portugais. Jo had not been able to
      bear the misery of suspense and anxiety, and had come seeking him. There
      was little speech between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have not been found out, M'sieu'?" was Jo's anxious question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, but I have had a bad night, Jo. Get the dogs together."
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later, as Charley made ready to go back to Chaudiere, Jo said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look as if you'd had a black dream, M'sieu'." With the river rustling
      by, and the trees stirring in the first breath of dawn, Charley told Jo
      what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the murderer did not speak or stir, for a struggle was going
      on in his breast also; then he stooped quickly, caught his companion's
      hand, and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not have done it, M'sieu'," he said hoarsely. They parted, Jo to
      remain behind as they had agreed, to be near Rosalie if needed; Charley to
      return to the valley of the Chaudiere.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER L. THE PASSION PLAY AT CHAUDIERE
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the first time in its history Chaudiere was becoming notable in the
      eyes of the outside world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll have more girth after this," said Filion Lacasse the saddler to the
      wife of the Notary, as, in front of the post-office, they stood watching a
      little cavalcade of habitants going up the road towards Four Mountains to
      rehearse the Passion Play.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Dauphin's advice had been taken long ago, we'd have had a hotel at
      Four Mountains, and the city folk would be coming here for the summer,"
      said Madame Dauphin, with a superior air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pish!" said a voice behind them. It was the Seigneur's groom, with a
      straw in his mouth. He had a gloomy mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There isn't a house but has two or three boarders. I've got three," said
      Filion Lacasse. "They come tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll have ten at the Manor. But no good will come of it," said the
      groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No good! Look at the infidel tailor!" said Madame Dauphin. "He translated
      all the writing. He drew all the dresses, and made a hundred pictures&mdash;there
      they are at the Cure's house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He should have played Judas," said the groom malevolently. "That'd be
      right for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you don't like the Passion Play," said Madame Dauphin
      disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We ain't through with it yet," said the death's-head groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a pious and holy mission," said Madame Dauphin. "Even that Jo
      Portugais worked night and day till he went away to Montreal, and he
      always goes to Mass now. He's to take Pontius Pilate when he comes back.
      Then look at Virginie Morrissette, that put her brother's eyes out
      quarrelling&mdash;she's to play Mary Magdalene."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could fit the parts better," said the groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. You'd have played St. John," said the saddler&mdash;"or,
      maybe, Christus himself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd have Paulette Dubois play Mary the sinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Magdalene repented, and knelt at the foot of the cross. She was sorry and
      sinned no more," said the Notary's wife in querulous reprimand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Paulette does all that," said the stolid, dark-visaged groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filion Lacasse's ears pricked up. "How do you know&mdash;she hasn't come
      back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hasn't she, though! And with her child too&mdash;last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her child!" Madame Dauphin was scandalised and amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The groom nodded. "And doesn't care who knows it. Seven years old, and as
      fine a child as ever was!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Narcisse&mdash;Narcisse!" called Madame Dauphin to her husband, who was
      coming up the street. She hastily repeated the groom's news to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Notary stuck his hand between the buttons of his waistcoat. "Well,
      well, my dear Madame," he said consequentially, "it is quite true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you know about it&mdash;whose child is it?" she asked, with
      curdling scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Sh-'sh!" said the Notary. Then, with an oratorical wave of his free
      hand: "The Church opens her arms to all&mdash;even to her who sinned much
      because she loved much, who, through woful years, searched the world for
      her child and found it not&mdash;hidden away, as it was, by the duplicity
      of sinful man"&mdash;and so on through tangled sentences, setting forth in
      broken terms Paulette Dubois's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know all about it?" asked the saddler. "I've known it for
      years," said the Notary grandly&mdash;stoutly too, for he would freely
      risk his wife's anger that the vain-glory of the moment might be enlarged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you keep it even from madame!" said the saddler, with a smile too
      broad to be sarcastic. "Tiens! if I did that, my wife'd pick my eyes out
      with a bradawl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a professional secret," said the Notary, with a desperate resolve
      to hold his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going home, Dauphin&mdash;are you coming?" questioned his wife, with
      an air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will remain, and hear what I've got to say. This Paulette Dubois&mdash;she
      should play Mary Magdalene, for&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look&mdash;look, what's that?" said the saddler. He pointed to a wagon
      coming slowly up the road. In front of it a team of dogs drew a cart. It
      carried some thing covered with black. "It's a funeral! There's the
      coffin. It's on Jo Portugais' little cart," added Filion Lacasse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, God be merciful, it's Rosalie Evanturel and Mrs. Flynn! And M'sieu'
      Evanturel in the coffin!" said Madame Dauphin, running to the door of the
      postoffice to call the Cure's sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There'll be use enough for the baker's Dead March now," remarked M.
      Dauphin sadly, buttoning up his coat, taking off his hat, and going
      forward to greet Rosalie. As he did so, Charley appeared in the doorway of
      his shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, Monsieur," said the Notary. "This is the way Rosalie Evanturel
      comes home with her father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go for the Cure" Charley answered, turning white. He leaned
      against the doorway for a moment to steady himself, then hurried up the
      street. He did not dare meet Rosalie, or go near her yet. For her sake it
      was better not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That tailor infidel has a heart. His eyes were leaking," said the Notary
      to Filion Lacasse, and went on to meet the mournful cavalcade.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LI. FACE TO FACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      "If I could only understand!"&mdash;this was Rosalie's constant cry in
      these weeks wherein she lay ill and prostrate after her father's burial.
      Once and once only had she met Charley alone, though she knew that he was
      keeping watch over her. She had first seen him the day her father was
      buried, standing apart from the people, his face sorrowful, his eyes
      heavy, his figure bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion of their meeting alone was the first night of her return,
      when the Notary and Charley had kept watch beside her father's body.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had gone into the little hallway, and had looked into the room of
      death. The Notary was sound asleep in his arm-chair, but Charley sat
      silent and moveless, his eyes gazing straight before him. She murmured his
      name, and though it was only to herself, not even a whisper, he got up
      quickly and came to the hall, where she stood grief-stricken, yet with a
      smile of welcome, of forgiveness, of confidence. As she put out her hand
      to him, and his swallowed it, she could not but say to him&mdash;so
      contrary is the heart of woman, so does she demand a Yes by asserting a
      No, and hunger for the eternal assurance&mdash;she could not but say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not love me&mdash;now."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but a whisper, so faint and breathless that only the heart of love
      could hear it. There was no answer in words, for some one was stirring
      beyond Rosalie in the dark, and a great figure heaved through the kitchen
      doorway, but his hand crushed hers in his own; his heart said to her, "My
      love is an undying light; it will not change for time or tears"&mdash;the
      words they had read together in a little snuff-coloured book on the
      counter in the shop one summer day a year ago. The words flashed into his
      mind, and they were carried to hers. Her fingers pressed his, and then
      Charley said, over her shoulder, to the approaching Mrs. Flynn: "Do not
      let her come again, Madame. She should get some sleep," and he put her
      hand in Mrs. Flynn's. "Be good to her, as you know how, Mrs. Flynn," he
      added gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had won the heart of Mrs. Flynn that moment, and it may be she had a
      conviction or an inspiration, for she said, in a softer voice than she was
      wont to use to any one save Rosalie:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll do by her as you'd do by your own, sir," and tenderly drew Rosalie
      to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such had been their first meeting after her return. Afterwards she was
      taken ill, and the torture of his heart drove him out into the night, to
      walk the road and creep round her house like a sentinel, Mrs. Flynn's
      words ringing in his ears to reproach him&mdash;"I'll do by her as you
      would do by your own, sir." Night after night it was the same, and Rosalie
      heard his footsteps and listened and was less sorrowful, because she knew
      that she was ever in his thoughts. But one day Mrs. Flynn came to him in
      his shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's wantin' a word with ye on business," she said, and gestured towards
      the little house across the way. "'Tis few words ye do be shpakin' to
      annybody, but if y' have kind words to shpake and good things to say, y'
      naidn't be bitin' yer tongue," she added in response to his nod, and left
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley looked after her with a troubled face. On the instant it seemed to
      him that Mrs. Flynn knew all. But his second thought told him that it was
      only an instinct on her part that there was something between them&mdash;the
      beginning of love, maybe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another half-hour he was beside Rosalie's chair. "Perhaps you are
      angry," she said, as he came towards her where she sat in the great
      arm-chair. She did not give him time to answer, but hurried on. "I wanted
      to tell you that I have heard you every night outside, and that I have
      been glad, and sorry too&mdash;so sorry for us both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie! Rosalie" he said hoarsely, and dropped on a knee beside her
      chair, and took her hand and kissed it. He did not dare do more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to say to you," she said, dropping a hand on his shoulder, "that
      I do not blame you for anything&mdash;not for anything. Yet I want you to
      be sorry too. I want you to feel as sorry for me as I feel sorry for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the worst man and you the best woman in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned over him with tears in her eyes. "Hush!" she said. "I want to
      help you&mdash;Charles. You are wise. You know ten thousand things more
      than I; but I know one thing you do not understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know and do whatever is good," he said brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, no, no! But I know one thing, because I have been taught, and
      because it was born with me. Perhaps much was habit with me in the past,
      but now I know that one thing is true. It is God."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. "I have learned so much since&mdash;since then."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up with a groan, and put a finger on her lips. "You are feeling
      bitterly sorry for me," she said. "But you must let me speak&mdash;that is
      all I ask. It is all love asks. I cannot bear that you should not share my
      thoughts. That is the thing that has hurt&mdash;hurt so all these months,
      these long hard months, when I could not see you, and did not know why I
      could not. Don't shake so, please! Hear me to the end, and we shall both
      be the better after. I felt it all so cruelly, because I did not&mdash;and
      I do not&mdash;understand. I rebelled, but not against you. I rebelled
      against myself, against what you called Fate. Fate is one's self, what one
      brings on one's self. But I had faith in you&mdash;always&mdash;always,
      even when I thought I hated you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, hate me! Hate me! It is your loving that cuts me to the quick," he
      said. "You have the magnanimity of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes leapt up. "'Of God'&mdash;you believe in God!" she said eagerly.
      "God is God to you? He is the one thing that has come out of all this to
      me." She reached out her hand and took her Bible from a table. "Read that
      to yourself," she said, and, opening the Book, pointed to a passage. He
      read it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in
   the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the
   presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.

   And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art
   thou?

   And he said, I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
   because I was naked; and I hid myself.

   And He said, Who told thee that thou wart naked? Hast thou eaten of
   the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
</pre>
    <p>
      Closing the Book, Charley said: "I understand&mdash;I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you say a prayer with me?" she urged. "It is all I ask. It is the
      only&mdash;the only thing I want to hurt you, because it may make you
      happier in the end. What keeps us apart, I do not know. But if you will
      say one prayer with me, I will keep on trusting, I will never complain,
      and I will wait&mdash;wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed both her hands, but the look in his eyes was that of a man being
      broken on the wheel. She slipped to the floor, her rosary in her fingers.
      "Let us pray," she said simply, and in a voice as clear as a child's, but
      with the anguish of a woman's struggling heart behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not move. She looked at him, caught his hands in both of hers, and
      cried: "But you will not deny me this! Haven't I the right to ask it?
      Haven't I a right to ask of you a thousand times as much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have the right to ask all that is mine to give life, honour, my body
      in pieces inch by inch, the last that I can call my own. But, Rosalie,
      this is not mine to give! How can I pray, unless I believe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do&mdash;oh, you do believe in God," she cried passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie&mdash;my life," he urged, hoarse misery in his voice, "the only
      thing I have to give you is the bare soul of a truthful man&mdash;I am
      that now at least. You have made me so. If I deceived the whole world, if
      I was as the thief upon the cross, I should still be truthful to you. You
      open your heart to me&mdash;let me open mine to you, to see it as it is.
      Once my soul was like a watch, cased and carried in the pocket of life,
      uncertain, untrue, because it was a soul made, not born. I must look at
      the hands to know the time, and because it varied, because the working did
      not answer to the absolute, I said: 'The soul is a lie.' You&mdash;you
      have changed all that, Rosalie. My soul now is like a dial to the sun. But
      the clouds are there above, and I do not know what time it is in life.
      When the clouds break&mdash;if they ever break&mdash;and the sun shines,
      the dial will speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, confused, for he had repeated the words of a witness taking the
      oath in court.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'So help me God!"' she finished the oath for him. Then, with a sudden
      change of manner, she came to her feet with a spring. She did not quite
      understand. She was, however, dimly conscious of the power she had over
      his chivalrous mind: the power of the weak over the strong&mdash;the
      tyranny of the defended over the defender. She was a woman tortured beyond
      bearing; and she was fighting for her very life, mad with anguish as she
      struggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand you," she cried, with flashing eyes. "One minute you
      say you do not believe in anything, and the next you say, 'So help me
      God!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, no, you said that, Rosalie," he interposed gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said I was as magnanimous as God. You were laughing at me then,
      mocking me, whose only fault is that I loved and trusted you. In the
      wickedness of your heart you robbed me of happiness, you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't&mdash;don't! Rosalie! Rosalie!" he exclaimed in shrinking protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she had spoken to him as her deepest heart abhorred only increased
      her agitated denunciation. "Yes, yes, in your mad selfishness, you did not
      care for the poor girl who forgot all, lost all, and now&mdash;" She
      stopped short at the sight of his white, awe stricken face. His eye-glass
      seemed like a frost of death over an eye that looked upon some shocking
      scene of woe. Yet he appeared not to see, for his fingers fumbled on his
      waistcoat for the monocle&mdash;fumbled&mdash;vaguely, helplessly. It was
      the realisation of a soul cast into the outer darkness. Her abrupt silence
      came upon him like the last engulfing wave to a drowning man&mdash;the
      final assurance of the end, in which there is quiet and the deadly
      smother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now&mdash;I know-the truth!" he said, in a curious even tone, different
      from any she had ever heard from him. It was the old Charley Steele who
      spoke, the Charley Steele in whom the intellect was supreme once more. The
      judicial spirit, the inveterate intelligence which put justice before all,
      was alive in him, almost rejoicing in its regained governance. The new
      Charley was as dead as the old had been of late, and this clarifying
      moment left the grim impression behind that the old law was not obsolete.
      He felt that in the abandonment of her indignation she had mercilessly
      told the truth; and the irreducible quality of mind in him which in the
      old days made for justice, approved. There was a new element now, however&mdash;that
      conscience which never possessed him fully until the day he saw Rosalie go
      travelling over the hills with her crippled father. That picture of the
      girl against the twilight, her figure silhouetted in the clear air, had
      come to him in sleeping and waking dreams, the type and sign of an
      everlasting melancholy. As he looked at her blindly now, he saw, not
      herself, but that melancholy figure. Out of the distance his own voice
      said again:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now&mdash;I know-the truth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had struck with a violence she did not intend, which, she knew, must
      rend her own heart in the future, which put in the dice-box the last hopes
      she had. But she could not have helped it&mdash;she could not have stayed
      the words, though a suspended sword were to fall with the saying. It was
      the cry of tradition and religion, and every home-bred, convent-nurtured
      habit, the instinct of heredity, the wail of woman, for whom destiny, or
      man, or nature, has arranged the disproportionate share of life's
      penalties. It was the impotent rebellion against the first curse, that man
      in his punishment should earn his bread by the sweat of his brow&mdash;which
      he might do with joy&mdash;while the woman must work out her ordained
      sentence "in sorrow all the days of her life."
    </p>
    <p>
      In her bitter words was the inherent revolt of the race of woman. But now
      she suddenly felt that she had flung him an infinite distance from her;
      that she had struck at the thing she most cherished&mdash;his belief that
      she loved him; that even if she had told the truth&mdash;and she felt she
      had not&mdash;it was not the truth she wished him most to feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant she stood looking at him, shocked and confounded, then her
      changeless love rushed back on her, the maternal and protective spirit
      welled up, and with a passionate cry she threw herself in the chair again
      in very weakness, with outstretched hands, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me&mdash;oh, forgive me! I did not mean it&mdash;oh, forgive your
      Rosalie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping over her, he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is good for me to know the whole truth. What hurts you may give me
      will pass&mdash;for life must end, and my life cannot be long enough to
      pay the price of the hurts I have given you. I could bear a thousand&mdash;one
      for every hour&mdash;if they could bring back the light to your eye, the
      joy to your heart. Could prayer, do you think, make me sorrier than I am?
      I have hurt what I would have spared from hurt at the cost of my life&mdash;and
      all the lives in all the world!" he added fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me&mdash;oh, forgive your Rosalie!" she pleaded. "I did not know
      what I was saying&mdash;I was mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was all so sane and true," he said, like one who, on the brink of
      death, finds a satisfaction in speaking the perfect truth. "I am glad to
      hear the truth&mdash;I have been such a liar."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up startled, her tears blinding her. "You have not deceived
      me?" she asked bitterly. "Oh, you have not deceived me&mdash;you have
      loved me, have you not?" It was that which mattered, that only. Moveless
      and eager, she looked&mdash;looked at him, waiting, as it were, for
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never lied to you, Rosalie&mdash;never!" he answered, and he touched
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a moan of relief at his words. "Oh, then, oh, then... " she said,
      in a low voice, and the tears in her eyes dried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I meant that until I knew you, I kept deceiving myself and others all my
      life&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But without knowing it?" she said eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, without quite knowing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Until you knew me?" she asked, in quick, quivering tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Till I knew you," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I have done you good&mdash;not ill?" she asked, with painful
      breathlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The only good there may be in me is you, and you only," he said, and he
      choked something rising in his throat, seeing the greatness of her heart,
      her dear desire to have entered into his life to his own good. He would
      have said that there was no good in him at all, but that he wished to
      comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little cry of joy broke from her lips. "Oh, that&mdash;that!" she cried,
      with happy tears. "Won't you kiss me now?" she added softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He clasped her in his arms, and though his eyes were dry, his heart wept
      tears of blood.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LII. THE COMING OF BILLY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Chaudiere had made&mdash;and lost&mdash;a reputation. The Passion Play in
      the valley had become known to a whole country&mdash;to the Cure's and the
      Seigneur's unavailing regret. They had meant to revive the great story for
      their own people and the Indians&mdash;a homely, beautiful object-lesson,
      in an Eden&mdash;like innocence and quiet and repose; but behold the world
      had invaded them! The vanity of the Notary had undone them. He had written
      to the great papers of the province, telling of the advent of the play,
      and pilgrimages had been organised, and excursions had been made to the
      spot, where a simple people had achieved a crude but noble picture of the
      life and death of the Hero of Christendom. The Cure viewed with
      consternation the invasion of their quiet. It was no longer his own
      Chaudiere; and when, on a Sunday, his dear people were jostled from the
      church to make room for strangers, his gentle eloquence seemed to forsake
      him, he spoke haltingly, and his intoning of the Mass lacked the old
      soothing simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my dear Seigneur!" he said, on the Sunday before the playing was to
      end, "we have overshot the mark."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur nodded and turned his head away. "There is an English play
      which says, 'I have shot mine arrow o'er the house and hurt my brother.'
      That's it&mdash;that's it! We began with religion, and we end with greed,
      and pride, and notoriety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do we want of fame! The price is too high, Maurice. Fame is not good
      for the hearts and minds of simple folk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will soon be over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dread a sordid reaction."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur stood thinking for a moment. "I have an idea," he said at
      last. "Let us have these last days to ourselves. The mission ends next
      Saturday at five o'clock. We will announce that all strangers must leave
      the valley by Wednesday night. Then, during those last three days, while
      yet the influence of the play is on them, you can lead your own people
      back to the old quiet feelings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Maurice&mdash;it is worthy of you! It is the way. We will
      announce it to-day. And see now.... For those three days we will change
      the principals; lest those who have taken the parts so long have lost the
      pious awe which should be upon them. We will put new people in their
      places. I will announce it at vespers presently. I have in my mind who
      should play the Christ, and St. John, and St. Peter&mdash;the men are not
      hard to find; but for Mary the Mother and Mary Magdalene&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the two men suddenly met, a look of understanding passed
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will she do it?" said the Seigneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure nodded. "Paulette Dubois has heard the word, 'Go and sin no
      more'; she will obey."
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking through the village as they talked, the Cure shrank back painfully
      several times, for voices of strangers, singing festive songs, rolled out
      upon the road. "Who can they be?" he said distressfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word the Seigneur went to the door of the inn whence the sounds
      proceeded, and, without knocking, entered. A moment afterwards the voices
      stopped, but broke out again, quieted, then once more broke out, and
      presently the Seigneur issued from the door, white with anger, three
      strangers behind him. All were intoxicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      One was violent. It was Billy Wantage, whom the years had not improved. He
      had arrived that day with two companions&mdash;an excursion of curiosity
      as an excuse for a "spree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter with you, old stick-in-the-mud?" he shouted. "Mass is
      over, isn't it? Can't we have a little guzzle between prayers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time a crowd had gathered, among them Filion Lacasse. At a motion
      from the Seigneur, and a whisper that went round quickly, a dozen
      habitants swiftly sprang on the three men, pinioned their arms, and
      carrying them bodily to the pump by the tavern, held them under it, one by
      one, till each was soaked and sober. Then their horses and wagon were
      brought, and they were given five minutes to leave the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a devilish look in his eye, and drenched and furious, Billy was
      disposed to resist the command, but the faces around him were determined,
      and, muttering curses, the three drove away towards the next parish.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIII. THE SEIGNEUR AND THE CURE HAVE A SUSPICION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Presently the Seigneur and the Cure stood before the door of the
      tailor-shop. The Cure was about to knock, when the Seigneur laid a hand
      upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no use; he has been gone several days," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone&mdash;gone!" said the Cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came to see him yesterday, and not finding him, I asked at the
      post-office." M. Rossignol's voice lowered. "He told Mrs. Flynn he was
      going into the hills, so Rosalie says."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure's face fell. "He went away also just before the play began. I
      almost fear that&mdash;that we get no nearer. His mind prompts him to do
      good and not evil, and yet&mdash;and yet.... I have dreamed a good dream,
      Maurice, but I sometimes fear I have dreamed in vain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait-wait!"
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Loisel looked towards the post-office musingly. "I have thought
      sometimes that what man's prayers may not accomplish a woman's love might
      do. If&mdash;but, alas, what do we know of his past! Nothing. What do we
      know of his future? Nothing. What do we know of the human heart? Nothing&mdash;nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur was astounded. The Cure's meaning was plain. "What do you
      mean?" he asked, almost gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She&mdash;Rosalie&mdash;has changed&mdash;changed." In his heart he dwelt
      sorrowfully upon the fact that she had not been to confession to him for
      many, many months.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since her father's death&mdash;since her illness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since she went to Montreal seven months ago. Even while she was so ill
      these past weeks, she never asked for me; and when I came... Ah, if it is
      that her heart has gone out to the man, and his does not respond!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good thing, too!" said the other gloomily. "We don't know where he came
      from, and we do know that he is a pagan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet there she sits now, hour after hour, day after day&mdash;so changed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has lost her father," urged M. Rossignol anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know the grief of children&mdash;this is not such a grief. There is
      something more. But I cannot ask. If she were a sinner&mdash;but she is
      without fault. Have we not watched her grow up here, mirthful, brave,
      pure-souled&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fitted for any station," interposed the Seigneur huskily. Presently he
      laid a hand upon the Cure's arm. "Shall I ask her again?" he said,
      breathing hard. "Do you think she has found out her mistake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure was so taken aback that at first he could not speak. When he
      realised, however, he could scarce suppress a smile at the other's simple
      vanity. But he mastered himself, and said: "It is not that, Maurice. It is
      not you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you know I had asked her?" asked his friend querulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have just told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Rossignol felt a kind of reproval in the Cure's tone. It made him a
      little nervous. "I'm an old fool, but she needed some one," he protested.
      "At least I am a gentleman, and she would not be thrown away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Maurice!" said the Cure, and linked his arm in the other's. "In all
      respects save one, it would have been to her advantage. But youth is the
      only comrade for youth. All else is evasion of life's laws."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur pressed his arm. "I thought you less worldly-wise than
      myself; I find you more," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not worldly-wise. Life is deeper than the world or worldly wisdom. Come,
      we will both go and see Rosalie."
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Rossignol suddenly stopped at the post-office door, and half turned
      towards the tailor-shop. "He is young. Suppose that he drew her love his
      way, but gave her nothing in return, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it were so"&mdash;the Cure paused, and his face darkened&mdash;"if it
      were so, he should leave her forever; and so my dream would end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Rosalie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie would forget. To remember, youth must see and touch and be near,
      else it wears itself out in excess of feeling. Youth feels more deeply
      than age, but it must bear daily witness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my honour, Cure, you shall write your little philosophies for the
      world," said M. Rossignol, and then knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go in alone, Maurice," the Cure urged. "Good-you are right,"
      answered the other. "I will go write the proclamation denying strangers
      the valley after Wednesday. I will enforce it, too," he added, with
      vigour, and, turning, walked up the street, as Mrs. Flynn admitted the
      Cure to the post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later M. Loisel again appeared at the post-office door, a
      pale, beautiful face at his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been brave enough to say what was on his mind. But as he bade
      her good-bye, he plucked up needful courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, Rosalie," he said, "but I have sometimes thought that you
      have more griefs than one. I have thought"&mdash;he paused, then went on
      bravely&mdash;"that there might be&mdash;there might be unwelcomed love,
      or love deceived."
    </p>
    <p>
      A mist came before her eyes, but she quietly and firmly answered: "I have
      never been deceived in love, Monsieur Loisel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there!" he hurriedly and gently rejoined. "Do not be hurt, my
      child. I only want to help you." A moment afterwards he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed behind him, she drew herself proudly up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never been deceived," she said aloud. "I love him&mdash;love him&mdash;love
      him."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIV. M. ROSSIGNOL SLIPS THE LEASH
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the last day of the Passion Play, and the great dramatic mission
      was drawing to a close. The confidence of the Cure and the Seigneur was
      restored. The prohibition against strangers had had its effect, and for
      three whole days the valley had been at rest again. Apparently there was
      not a stranger within its borders, save the Seigneur's brother, the Abbe
      Rossignol, who had come to see the moving spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe, on his arrival, had made inquiries concerning the tailor of
      Chaudiere and Jo Portugais, as persistently about the one as the other.
      Their secrets had been kept inviolate by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was disconcerting to hear the tales people told of the tailor's charity
      and wisdom. It was all dangerous, for what was, accidentally, no evil in
      this particular instance, might be the greatest disaster in another case.
      Principle was at stake. He heard in stern silence the Cure's happy
      statement that Jo Portugais had returned to the bosom of the Church, and
      attended Mass regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it may be, my dear Abbe," said M. Loisel, "that the friendship between
      him and our 'infidel' has been the means of helping Portugais. I hope
      their friendship will go on unbroken for years and years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no idea that it will," said the Abbe grimly. "That rope of
      friendship may snap untimely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my soul, you croak like a raven!" testily broke in M. Rossignol, who
      was present. "I didn't know there was so much in common between you and my
      surly-jowled groom. He gets his pleasure out of croaking. 'Wait, wait,
      you'll see&mdash;you'll see! Death, death, death&mdash;every man must die!
      The devil has you by the hair&mdash;death&mdash;death&mdash;death!' Bah!
      I'm heartily sick of croakers. I suppose, like my grunting groom, you'll
      say about the Passion Play, 'No good will come of it&mdash;wait&mdash;wait&mdash;wait!'
      Bah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may not be an unmixed good," answered the ascetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and is there any such thing on earth as an unmixed good? The play
      yesterday was worth a thousand sermons. It was meant to serve Holy Church,
      and it will serve it. Was there ever anything more real&mdash;and touching&mdash;than
      Paulette Dubois as Mary Magdalene yesterday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not approve of such reality. For that woman to play the part is to
      destroy the impersonality of the scene."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would demand that the Christus should be a good man, and the St. John
      blameless&mdash;why shouldn't the Magdalene be a repentant woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might impress the people more, if the best woman in your parish were
      to play the part. The fall of virtue, the ruin of innocence, would be
      vividly brought home. It does good to make the innocent feel the terror
      and shame of sin. That is the price the good pay for the fall of man&mdash;sorrow
      and shame for those who sin." The Seigneur, rising quickly from the table,
      and kicking his chair back, said angrily: "Damn your theories!" Then,
      seeing the frozen look on his brother's face, continued, more excitedly:
      "Yes, damn, damn, damn your theories! You always took the crass view. I
      beg your pardon, Cure&mdash;I beg your pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then went to the window, threw it open, and called to his groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi, there, coffin-face," he said, "bring round the horses&mdash;the
      quietest one in the stable for my brother&mdash;you hear? He can't ride,"
      he added maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was his fiercest stroke, for the Abbe's secret vanity was the belief
      that he looked well on a horse, and rode handsomely.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LV. ROSALIE PLAYS A PART
    </h2>
    <p>
      From a tree upon a little hill rang out a bell&mdash;a deep-toned bell,
      bought by the parish years before for the missions held at this very spot.
      Every day it rang for an instant at the beginning of each of the five
      acts. It also tolled slowly when the curtain rose upon the scene of the
      Crucifixion. In this act no one spoke save the abased Magdalene, who knelt
      at the foot of the cross, and on whose hair red drops fell when the Roman
      soldier pierced the side of the figure on the cross. This had been the
      Cure's idea. The Magdalene should speak for mankind, for the continuing
      world. She should speak for the broken and contrite heart in all ages,
      should be the first-fruits of the sacrifice, a flower of the desert earth,
      bedewed by the blood of the Prince of Peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in the long nights of the late winter and early spring, the Cure had
      thought and thought upon what the woman should say from the foot of the
      cross. At last he put into her mouth that which told the whole story of
      redemption and deliverance, so far as his heart could conceive it&mdash;the
      prayer for all sorts and conditions of men and the general thanksgiving of
      humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last three days Paulette Dubois had taken the part of Mary
      Magdalene. As Jo Portugais had confessed to the Abbe that notable day in
      the woods at Vadrome Mountain, so she had confessed to the Cure after so
      many years of agony&mdash;and the one confession fitted into the other: Jo
      had once loved her, she had treated him vilely, then a man had wronged
      her, and Jo had avenged her&mdash;this was the tale in brief. She it was
      who laughed in the gallery of the court-room the day that Joseph Nadeau
      was acquitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had pained and shocked the Cure more than any he had ever heard, but he
      urged for her no penalty as Portugais had set for himself with the austere
      approval of the Abbe. Paulette's presence as the Magdalene had had a deep
      effect upon the people, so that she shared with Mary the Mother the
      painfully real interest of the vast audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five times had the bell rung out in the perfect spring air, upon which the
      balm of the forest and the refreshment of the ardent sun were poured. The
      quick anger of M. Rossignol had passed away long before the Cure, the
      Abbe, and himself had reached the lake and the great plateau. Between the
      acts the two brothers walked up and down together, at peace once more, and
      there was a suspicious moisture in the Seigneur's eyes. The demeanour of
      the people had been so humble and rapt that the place and the plateau and
      the valley seemed alone in creation with the lofty drama of the ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure's eyes shone when he saw on a little knoll in the trees, apart
      from the worshippers and spectators, Charley and Jo Portugais. His cup of
      content was now full. He had felt convinced that if the tailor had but
      been within these bounds during the past three days, a work were begun
      which should end only at the altar of their parish church. To-day the play
      became to him the engine of God for the saving of a man's soul. Not long
      before the last great tableau was to appear he went to his own little tent
      near the hut where the actors prepared to go upon the stage. As he
      entered, some one came quickly forward from the shadow of the trees and
      touched him on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie!" he cried in amazement, for she wore the costume of Mary
      Magdalene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is I, not Paulette, who will appear," she said, a deep light in her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, Rosalie?" he asked dumfounded. "You are distrait. Trouble and sorrow
      have put this in your mind. You must not do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am going there," she said, pointing towards the great stage.
      "Paulette has given me these to wear"&mdash;she touched the robe&mdash;"and
      I only ask your blessing now. Oh, believe, believe me, I can speak for
      those who are innocent and those who are guilty; for those who pray and
      those who cannot pray; for those who confess and those who dare not! I can
      speak the words out of my heart with gladness and agony, Monsieur," she
      urged, in a voice vibrating with feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      A luminous look came into the Cure's face. A thought leapt up in his
      heart. Who could tell!&mdash;this pure girl, speaking for the whole
      sinful, unbelieving, and believing world, might be the one last conquering
      argument to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not read the agony of spirit which had driven Rosalie to this&mdash;to
      confess through the words of Mary Magdalene her own woe, to say it out to
      all the world, and to receive, as did Paulette Dubois, every day after the
      curtain came down, absolution and blessing. She longed for the old
      remembered peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure could not read the struggle between her love for a man and the
      ineradicable habit of her soul; but he raised his hand, made the sacred
      gesture over leer, and said: "Go, my child, and God be with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not see her for tears as she hurried away to where Paulette
      Dubois awaited her&mdash;the two at peace now. At the hands of the lately
      despised and injurious woman Rosalie was made ready to play the part in
      the last act, none knowing save the few who appeared in the final tableau,
      and they at the last moment only.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell began to toll.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand people fell upon their knees, and with fascinated yet abashed
      and awe-struck eyes saw the great tableau of Christendom: the three
      crosses against the evening sky, the Figure in the centre, the Roman
      populace, the trembling Jews, the pathetic groups of disciples. A cloud
      passed across the sky, the illusion grew, and hearts quivered in piteous
      sympathy. There was no music now&mdash;not a sound save the sob of some
      overwrought woman. The woe of an oppressed world absorbed them. Even the
      stolid Indians, as Roman soldiers, shrank awe-stricken from the sacred
      tragedy. Now the eyes of all were upon the central Figure, then they
      shifted for a moment to John the Beloved, standing with the Mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pauvre Mere! Pauvre Christ!" said a weeping woman aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Roman soldier raised a spear and pierced the side of the Hero of the
      World. Blood flowed, and hundreds gasped. Then there was silence&mdash;a
      strange hush as of a prelude to some great event.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is finished. Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit," said the
      Figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hush was broken by such a sound as one hears in a forest when a wind
      quivers over the earth, flutters the leaves, and then sinks away&mdash;neither
      having come nor gone, but only lived and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was silence, and then all eyes were fixed upon the figure at
      the foot of the cross-Mary the Magdalene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day they had seen this figure rise, come forward a step, and
      speak the epilogue to this moving miracle-drama. For the last three days
      Paulette Dubois had turned a sorrowful face upon them, and with one hand
      upraised had spoken the prayer, the prophecy, the thanksgiving, the appeal
      of humanity and the ages. They looked to see the same figure now, and
      waited. But as the Magdalene turned, there was a great stir in the
      multitude, for the face bent upon them was that of Rosalie Evanturel. Awe
      and wonder moved the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from the crowd, under a clump of trees, knelt a woodsman from
      Vadrome Mountain, and the tailor of Chaudiere stood beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Charley, touched by the heavy scene, saw the figure of the Magdalene
      rise, he felt a curious thrill of fascination. When she turned, and he saw
      the face of Rosalie, the blood rushed to his face; then his heart seemed
      to stand still. Pain and shame travelled to the farthest recesses of his
      nature. Jo Portugais rose to his feet with a startled exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie began to speak. "This is the day of which the hours shall never
      cease&mdash;in it there shall be no night. He whom ye have crucified hath
      saved you from the wrath to come. He hath saved others, Himself He would
      not save. Even for such as I, who have secretly opened, who have secretly
      entered, the doors of sin&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a gasp of horror and a mad desire to take her away from the sight of
      this gaping, fascinated crowd, Charley made to rush forward, but Jo
      Portugais held him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be still. You will ruin her, M'sieu'!" said Jo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;even for such as I am," the beautiful voice went on, "hath He
      died. And in the ages to come, women such as I, and all women who sorrow,
      and all men who err and are deceived, and all the helpless world, will
      know that this was the Friend of the human soul." Not a gesture, not a
      movement, only that slight, pathetic figure, with pale, agonised face, and
      eyes that looked&mdash;looked&mdash;looked beyond them, over their heads
      to the darkening east, the clouded light of evening behind her. Her voice
      rang out now valiant and clear, now searching and piteous, yet reaching to
      where the farthermost person knelt, and was lost upon the lake and in the
      spreading trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ye have done may never be undone; what He hath said shall never be
      unsaid. His is the Word which shall unite all languages, when ye that are
      Romans shall be no more Romans, and ye that are Jews shall still be Jews,
      reproached and alone. No longer shall men faint in the glare&mdash;the
      shadow of the Cross shall screen them. No more shall woman bear her black
      sorrows, alone; the Light of the World shall cheer her."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, the cloud drew back from the sunset, and the saffron glow
      behind lighted the cross, and shone upon her hair, casting her face in a
      gracious shadow. Her voice rose higher. "I, the Magdalene, am the
      first-fruits of this sacrifice: from the foot of the cross I come. I have
      sinned more than all. I have shamed all women. But I have confessed my
      sin, and He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
      from all unrighteousness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice now became lower, but clear and even, pathetically exulting:
    </p>
    <p>
      "O world, forgive, as He hath forgiven you! Fall, dark curtain, and hide
      this pain, and rise again upon forgiven sin and a redeemed people!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood still, with her eyes upraised, and the curtain came slowly down.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time no one in all the gathered multitude stirred. Far over
      under the trees a man sat upon the ground, his head upon his arms, and his
      arms upon his knees, in a misery unmeasurable. Beside him stood a
      woodsman, who knew of no word to say that might comfort him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl, in the garb of the Magdalene, entered the tent of the Cure, and,
      speaking no word, knelt and received absolution of her sins.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVI. MRS. FLYNN SPEAKS
    </h2>
    <p>
      CHARLEY left Jo Portugais behind, and went home alone. He watched at a
      window till he saw Rosalie return. As she passed quickly down the street
      with Mrs. Flynn to her own door, he observed that her face was happier
      than he had seen it for many a day. Her step was lighter, there was a
      freedom in her air, a sense of confidence in her carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bore herself as one who had done a thing which relaxed a painful
      tension. There was a curious glow in her eyes and face, and this became
      deeper as, showing himself at the door, she saw him, smiled, and stood
      still. He came across the street and took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been away," she said softly. "For a few days," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Vadrome Mountain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have missed these last days of the Passion Play," she said, a shadow
      in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was present to-day," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away her head quickly, for the look in his eyes told her more
      than any words could have done, and Mrs. Flynn said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis a day for everlastin' mimory, sir. For the part she played this day,
      the darlin', only such as she could play! 'Tis the innocent takin' the
      shame o' the guilty, and the tears do be comin' to me eyes. 'Tis not ould
      Widdy Flynn's eyes alone that's wet this day, but hearts do be weepin' for
      the love o' God."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie suddenly opened the door, and, without another look at Charley,
      entered the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis one in a million!" said Mrs. Flynn, in a confidential tone, for she
      had a fixed idea that Rosalie loved Charley and that he loved her, and
      that the only thing that stood in the way of their marriage was religion.
      From the first Charley had conquered Mrs. Flynn. That he was a tailor was
      a pity and a shame, but love was love, and the man had a head on him and a
      heart in him; and love was love! So Mrs. Flynn said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis one that a man that's a man should do annything for, was it havin'
      the heart cut out uv him, or givin' the last drop uv his blood. Shure, for
      such as her, murder, or false witness, or givin' up the last wish or
      thought a man hugged to his boosom, would be as aisy as aisy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley laughed to himself, her purpose was so obvious, but his heart went
      out to her, for she was a friend, and, whatever came to him, Rosalie would
      not be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe every word of yours," he said, shaking her hand, "and we'll
      see, you and I, that no man marries her who isn't ready to do what you
      say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you do it yourself&mdash;if it was you?" she asked, flushing for
      her boldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then do it," she said, and fled inside the house and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Flynn&mdash;good Mrs. Flynn!" he said, and went back sadly to his
      house, and shut himself up with his thoughts. When night drew on he went
      to bed, but he could not sleep. He got up after a time, and taking pen and
      paper, wrote for a long time. Having finished, he took what he had
      written, and placing it with the two packets-of money and pearls&mdash;which
      he had brought from his old home, he addressed it to the Cure, and going
      to the safe in the wall of the shop, placed them inside and locked the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went to bed, and slept soundly&mdash;the deep sleep of the just.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVII. A BURNING FIERY FURNACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every man within the limits of the parish was in his bed, save one. He was
      a stranger who, once before, had visited Chaudiere for one brief day, when
      he had been saved from death at the Red Ravine, and had fled the village
      that night because, as he thought, he had heard the voice of his old
      friend's ghost in the trees. Since that time he had travelled in many
      parishes, healing where he could, entertaining where he might, earning
      money as the charlatan. He was now on his way back through the parishes to
      Montreal, and his route lay through Chaudiere. He had hoped to reach
      Chaudiere before nightfall&mdash;he remembered with fear the incident from
      which he had fled many months before; but his horse had broken its leg on
      a corduroy bridge, a few miles out from the parish in the hills, and
      darkness came upon him before he could hide his wagon in the woods and
      proceed afoot to Chaudiere. He had shot his horse, and rolled it into the
      swift torrent beneath the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travelling the lonely road, he drank freely from the whiskey-horn he
      carried, to keep his spirits up, so that by the time he came to the
      outskirts of Chaudiere he was in a state of intoxication, and reeled
      impudently along with the "Dutch courage" the liquor had given him.
      Arrived at the first cluster of houses in the place, he paused uncertain.
      Should he knock here or go on to the tavern? He shivered at thought of the
      tavern, for it was near it he had heard Charley Steele's voice calling to
      him out of the trees. If he knocked here, would the people admit him in
      his present state?&mdash;he had sense enough to know that he was very
      drunk. As he shook his head in owlish gravity, he saw the church on the
      hill not far away. He chuckled to himself. The carpet in the chancel and
      the hassocks at the altar would make a good bed. No fear of Charley's
      ghost coming inside the church&mdash;it wouldn't be that kind of a ghost.
      As he travelled the intervening space, shrugging his shoulders, staggering
      serenely, he told himself in confidence that he would leave the church at
      dawn, go to the tavern, purchase a horse as soon as might be, and get back
      to his wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church door was unlocked, and he entered and made his way to the
      chancel, found surplices in the vestry and put a hassock inside one for a
      pillow. Then he sat down and drew the loose rug of the chancel-floor over
      him, and took another drink from the whiskey horn. Lighting his pipe, he
      smoked for a while, but grew drowsy, and his pipe fell into his lap. With
      eyes nearly shut he struck another match, made to light his pipe again,
      but threw the match away, still burning. As he did so the pipe dropped
      again from his mouth, and he fell back on the hassock-pillow he had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lighted match fell on a surplice which had dropped from his arms as he
      came from the vestry, and set it afire. In five minutes the whole chancel
      was burning, and the sleeping man waked in the midst of smoke and flame.
      He staggered to his feet with a terror-stricken cry, stumbled down the
      aisle, through the front door, and out into the night. Reaching the road,
      he turned his face again to the hill where his wagon lay hid. If he could
      reach that, he would be safe; nobody would suspect him. He clutched the
      whiskey-horn tight and broke into a run. As he passed beyond the village
      his excited imagination heard Charley Steele's ghost calling after him. He
      ran harder. The voice kept calling from Chaudiere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not Charley's voice, but the voices of many people in Chaudiere were
      calling. Some wakeful person had seen the glare in the church windows and
      had given the alarm, and now there rang through the streets the
      call-"Fire! Fire! Fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley and Jo were among the last to wake, for both had slept soundly,
      but Jo was roused by a handful of gravel thrown at his window and a
      warning cry, and a few moments later he and Charley were in the street
      with a hurrying crowd. Over all the village was a red glare, lighting up
      the sky, burnishing the trees. The church was a mass of flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley was as pale as the rest of the crowd; for he thought of the Cure,
      he thought of this people to whom their church meant more than home and
      vastly more than friend and fortune. His heart was with them all: not
      because it was their church that was burning, but because it was something
      dear to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the hill, he saw the Cure coming from the vestry of the burning
      church, bearing some vessels of the altar. Depositing them in the arms of
      his weeping sister, he turned again towards the door. People clung to him,
      and would not let him go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See, it is all inflames," they cried. "Your cassock is singed. You shall
      not go."
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Charley and Portugais came up. A hurried question to the
      Cure from Charley, a key handed over, a nod from Jo, and before the Cure
      could prevent them the two men had rushed through the smoke and flame into
      the vestry, Portugais holding Charley's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd outside waited in a terrible anxiety. The timbers of the chancel
      portion of the building seemed about to fall, and still the two men did
      not appear. The people called; the Cure clinched his hands at his side&mdash;he
      was too fearful even to pray.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the two men appeared, loaded with the few treasures of the church.
      They were scorched and singed, and the beards of both were burned, but,
      stumbling and exhausted, they brought their loads to the eager arms of the
      waiting habitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then from the other end of the church came a cry: "The little cross&mdash;the
      little iron cross!" Then another cry: "Rosalie Evanturel! Rosalie
      Evanturel!" Some one came running to the Cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie Evanturel has gone inside for the little cross on the pillar. She
      is in the flames; the door has fallen in. She can't get out again."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a hoarse cry, Charley darted back inside the vestry door. A cry of
      horror went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a minute and a half, but it seemed like years, and then a man
      in flames appeared in the fiery porch&mdash;and not alone. He carried a
      girl in his arms. He wavered even at the threshold with the timbers
      swaying overhead, but, with a last effort, he plunged forward through the
      furnace, and was caught by eager hands on the margin of endurable heat.
      The two were smothered in quilts brought from the Cure's house, and
      carried swiftly to the cool safety of the grass and trees beyond. The
      woman had fainted in the flame of the church; the man dropped insensible
      as they caught her from his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they tore away Charley's coat muffling his face, and opened his shirt,
      they stared in awe. The cross which Rosalie had torn from the pillar,
      Charley had thrust into his bosom, and there it now lay on the red scar
      made by itself in the hands of Louis Trudel.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Loisel waved the people back. He raised Charley's head. The Abbe
      Rossignol, who had just arrived with the Seigneur, lifted the cross from
      the insensible man's breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started when he saw the scar. Then he remembered the tale he had heard.
      He turned away gravely to his brother. "Was it the cross or the woman he
      went for?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great God&mdash;do you ask!" the Seigneur said indignantly. "And he
      deserves her," he muttered under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley opened his eyes. "Is she safe?" he asked, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unscathed, my son," the Cure said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this tailor-man not his son? Had he not thirsted for his soul as a
      hart for the water-brooks?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry for you, Monsieur," said Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is God's will," was the reply, in a choking voice. "It will be years
      before we have another church&mdash;many, many years."
    </p>
    <p>
      The roof gave way with a crash, and the spire shot down into the flaming
      debris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will cost sixty thousand dollars to build it up again," said Filion
      Lacasse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have three thousand dollars from the Passion Play," said the Notary.
      "That could go towards it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have another two thousand in the bank," said Maximilian Cour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it will take years," said the saddler disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley looked at the Cure, mournful and broken but calm. He saw the
      Seigneur, gloomy and silent, standing apart. He saw the people in
      scattered groups, looking more homeless than if they had no homes. Some
      groups were silent; others discussed angrily the question, who was the
      incendiary&mdash;that it had been set on fire seemed certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said no good would come of the play-acting," said the Seigneur's groom,
      and was flung into the ditch by Filion Lacasse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Charley staggered to his feet, purpose in his face. These
      people, from the Cure and Seigneur to the most ignorant habitant, were
      hopeless and inert. The pride of their lives was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gather the people together," he said to the Notary and Filion Lacasse.
      Then he turned to the Cure and the Seigneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With your permission, messieurs," he said, "I will do a harder thing than
      I have ever done. I will speak to them all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wondering, M. Loisel added his voice to the Notary's, and the word went
      round. Slowly they all made their way to a spot the Cure indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley stood on the embankment above the road, the notables of the parish
      round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie had been taken to the Cure's house. In that wild moment in the
      church when she had fallen insensible in Charley's arms, a new feeling had
      sprung up in her. She loved him in every fibre, but she had a strange
      instinct, a prescience, that she was lying on his breast for the last
      time. She had wound her arms round his neck, and, as his lips closed on
      hers, she had cried: "We shall die together&mdash;together."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she lay in the Cure's house, she thought only of that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are they cheering for?" she asked, as a great noise came to her
      through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run and see," said the Cure's sister to Mrs. Flynn, and the fat woman
      hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie raised herself so that she could look out of the window. "I can
      see him," she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See whom?" asked the Cure's sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," she answered, with a changed voice. "He is speaking. They are
      cheering him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later, the Cure and the Notary entered the room. M. Loisel
      came forward to Rosalie, and took her hands in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should not have done it," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to do something," she replied. "To get the cross for you seemed
      the only payment I could make for all your goodness to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It nearly cost you your life&mdash;and the life of another," he said,
      shaking his head reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheering came again from the burning church. "Why do they cheer?" she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do they cheer? Because the man we have feared, Monsieur Mallard&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never feared him," said Rosalie, scarcely above her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he has taught them the way to a new church again&mdash;and at
      once, at once, my child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A remarkable man!" said Narcisse Dauphin. "There never was such a speech.
      Never in any courtroom was there such an appeal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did he do?" asked Mademoiselle Loisel, her hand in Rosalie's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything," answered the Cure. "There he stood in his tattered clothes,
      the beard burnt to his chin, his hands scorched, his eyes bloodshot, and
      he spoke&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'With the tongues of men and of angels,'" said M. Dauphin
      enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure frowned and continued: "'You look on yonder burning walls,' he
      said, 'and wonder when they will rise again on this hill made sacred by
      the burial of your beloved, by the christening of your children, the
      marriages which have given you happy homes, and the sacraments which are
      to you the laws of your lives. You give one-twentieth of your income
      yearly towards your church&mdash;then give one-fortieth of all you possess
      today, and your church will be begun in a month. Before a year goes round
      you will come again to this venerable spot and enter another church here.
      Your vows, your memories, and your hopes will be purged by fire. All that
      you possess will be consecrated by your free-will offerings.'&mdash;Ah, if
      I could but remember what came afterwards! It was all eloquence, and
      generous and noble thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He spoke of you," said the Notary&mdash;"he spoke the truth; and the
      people cheered. He said that the man outside the walls could sometimes
      tell the besieged the way relief would come. Never again shall I hear such
      a speech."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are they going to do?" asked Rosalie, and withdrew her trembling
      hand from that of Madame Dugal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This very day, at my office, they will bring their offerings, and we will
      begin at once," answered M. Dauphin. "There is no man in Chaudiere but
      will take the stocking from the hole, the bag from the chest, the credit
      from the bank, the grain from the barn for the market, or make the note of
      hand to contribute one-fortieth of all he is worth for the rebuilding of
      the church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Notes of hand are not money," said the Cure's sister, the practical sense
      ever uppermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They shall all be money&mdash;hard cash," said the Notary. "The Seigneur
      is going to open a sort of bank, and take up the notes of hand, and give
      bank-bills in return. To-day I go with his steward to Quebec to get the
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does the Abbe Rossignol say?" said the Cure's sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our church and parish are our own," interposed the Cure proudly. "We do
      our duty and fear no abbe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Voila!" said M. Dauphin, "he never can keep hands off. I saw him go to Jo
      Portugais a little while ago. 'Remember!' he said&mdash;I can't make out
      what he was after. We have enough to remember to-day, for sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good may come of it, perhaps," said M. Loisel, looking sadly out upon the
      ruins of his church.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See, 'tis the sunrise!" said Mrs. Flynn's voice from the corner, her face
      towards the eastern window.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVIII. WITH HIS BACK TO THE WALL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In four days ten thousand dollars in notes and gold had been brought to
      the office of the Notary by the faithful people of Chaudiere. All day in
      turn M. Loisel and M. Rossignol sat in the office and received that which
      represented one-fortieth of the value of each man's goods, estate, and
      wealth&mdash;the fortieth value of a woodsawyer's cottage, or a widow's
      garden. They did it impartially for all, as the Cure and three of the
      best-to-do habitants had done for the Seigneur, whose four thousand
      dollars had been paid in first of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley had been confined to his room for three days, because of his
      injuries and a feverish cold he had caught, and the habitants did not
      disturb his quiet. But Mrs. Flynn took him broth made by Rosalie's hands,
      and Rosalie fought with her desire to go to him and nurse him. She was
      not, however, the Rosalie of the old impulse and impetuous resolve&mdash;the
      arrow had gone too deep; she waited till she could see his face again and
      look into his eyes. Not apathy, but a sense of the inevitable was upon
      her, and pale and fragile, but with a calm spirit, she waited for she knew
      not what.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that the day of fate was closing down. She must hold herself
      ready for the hour when he would need her most. At first, when the
      conviction had come to her that the end of all was near, she had revolted.
      She had had impulse to go to him at all hazards, to say to him: "Come away&mdash;anywhere,
      anywhere!" But that had given place to the deeper thing in her, and
      something of Charley's spirit of stoic waiting had come upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched the people going to the Notary's office with their tributes
      and free-will offerings, and they seemed like people in a play&mdash;these
      days she lived no life which was theirs. It was a dream, unimportant and
      temporary. She was feeling what was behind all life, and permanent. It
      could not last, but there it was; and she could not return to the
      transitory till this cloud of fate was lifted. She was much too young to
      suffer so, but the young ever suffer most.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth day she saw Charley. He came from his shop and went to the
      Notary's office. At first she was startled, for he was clean-shaven&mdash;the
      fire had burned his beard to the skin. She saw a different man, far
      removed from this life about them both&mdash;individual, singular. He was
      pale, and his eye-glass, with the cleanshaven face, gave an impression of
      refined separateness. She did not know that the same look was in both
      their faces. She watched him till he entered the Notary's shop, then she
      was called away to her duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley had come to give his one-fortieth with the rest. When he entered
      the Notary's office, the Seigneur and M. Dauphin stood up to greet him.
      They congratulated him on his recovery, while feeling also that the change
      in his personal appearance somehow affected their relations. A crowd
      gathered round the door of the shop. When Charley made his offering, with
      a statement of his goods and income, the Seigneur and Notary did not know
      what to do. They were disposed to decline it, for since Monsieur was no
      Catholic, it was not his duty to help. At this moment of delicate anxiety
      M. Loisel entered. With a swift bright flush to his cheek he saw the
      difficulty, and at once accepted freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless you," he said, as he took the money, and Charley left. "It
      shall build the doorway of my church."
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day the Cure sent for Charley. There were grave matters to
      consider, and his counsel was greatly needed. They had all come to depend
      on the soundness of his judgment. It had never gone astray in Chaudiere,
      they said. They owed to him this extraordinary scheme, which would be an
      example to all modern Christianity. They told him so. He said nothing in
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour he had planned for them a scheme for the consideration of
      contractors; had drawn, with the help of M. Loisel, an architect's rough
      plan of the new church, and, his old professional instincts keenly alive,
      had lucidly suggested the terms and safeguards of the contracts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the question of the money contributed. The day before, M.
      Dauphin and the Seigneur's steward had arrived in safety from Quebec with
      twenty thousand dollars in bank-bills. These M. Rossignol had exchanged
      for the notes of hand of such of the habitants as had not ready cash to
      give. All of this twenty thousand dollars had been paid over. They had now
      thirty thousand dollars in cash, besides three thousand which the Cure had
      at his house, the proceeds of the Passion Play. It was proposed to send
      this large sum to the bank in Quebec in another two days, when the whole
      contributions should be complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the safety of the money, the timid M. Dauphin did not care to take
      responsibility. Strangers were still arriving, ignorant of the fact that
      the Passion Play had ceased, and some of them must be aware that this
      large sum of money was in the parish&mdash;no doubt also knew that it was
      in his house. It was therefore better, he urged, that M. Rossignol or the
      Cure should take charge of it. M. Loisel urged that secrecy as to the
      resting-place of the money was important. It was better that it should be
      deposited in the most unlikely place, and with some unofficial person who
      might not be supposed to have it in charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have it!" said the Seigneur. "The money shall be placed in old Louis
      Trudel's safe in the wall of the tailor-shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so arranged, after Charley's protests of unwillingness, and
      counter-appeals from the others. That evening at sundown thirty-three
      thousand dollars was deposited in the safe in the old stone wall of the
      tailorshop, and the lock was sealed with the parish seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Notary's wife had wormed the secret from her husband, and she
      found it hard to keep. She told it to Maximilian Cour, and he kept it. She
      told it to her cousin, the wife of Filion Lacasse, and she did not keep
      it. Before twenty-four hours went round, a dozen people knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of the second day, another two thousand dollars was added to
      the treasure, and the lock was again sealed&mdash;with the utmost secrecy.
      Charley and Jo Portugais, the infidel and the murderer, were thus the
      sentries to the peace of a parish, the bankers of its gifts, the security
      for the future of the church of Chaudiere. Their weapons of defence were
      two old pistols belonging to the Seigneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Money is the master of the unexpected," the Seigneur had said as he
      handed them over. He chuckled for hours afterwards as he thought of his
      epigram. That night, as he turned over in bed for the third time, as was
      his custom before going to sleep, another epigram came to him&mdash;"Money
      is the only fox hunted night and day." He kept repeating it over and over
      again with vain pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth of M. Rossignol's aphorisms had been demonstrated several days
      before. On his return from Quebec with the twenty thousand dollars of the
      Seigneur's money, M. Dauphin had dwelt with great pride on the discretion
      and energy he and the steward had shown; had told dramatically of the
      skill which had enabled them to make a journey of such importance so
      secretly and safely; had covered himself with blushes for his own coolness
      and intrepidity. Fortune had, however, favoured his reputation and his
      intrepidity, for he had been pursued from the hour he and his companion
      left Quebec. A taste for the picturesque had impelled him to arrange for
      two relays of horses, and this fact saved him and the twenty thousand
      dollars he carried. Two hours after he had left Quebec, four determined
      men had got upon his trail, and had only been prevented from overtaking
      him by the freshness of the horses which his dramatic foresight had
      provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leader of these four pursuers was Billy Wantage, who had come to know
      of the curious action of the Seigneur of Chaudiere from an intimate
      friend, a clerk in the bank. Billy's fortunes were now in a bad way, and,
      in desperate straits for money, he had planned this bold attempt at the
      highwayman's art with two gamblers, to whom he owed money, and a certain
      notorious horse-trader of whom he had made a companion of late. Having
      escaped punishment for a crime once before, through Charley's supposed
      death, the immunity nerved him to this later and more dangerous
      enterprise. The four rode as hard as their horses would permit, but M.
      Dauphin and his companion kept always an hour or more ahead, and, from the
      high hills overlooking the village, Billy and his friends saw the two
      enter it safely in the light of evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      His three friends urged Billy to turn back, since they were out of
      provisions and had no shelter. It was unwise to go to a tavern or a
      farmer's house, where they must certainly be suspected. Billy, however,
      determined to make an effort to find the banking-place of the money, and
      refused to turn back without a trial. He therefore proposed that they
      should separate, going different directions, secure accommodation for the
      night, rest the following day, and meet the next night at a point
      indicated. This was agreed upon, and they separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the four met again, Billy had nothing to communicate, as he had been
      taken ill during the night before, and had been unable to go secretly into
      Chaudiere village. They separated once more. When they met the next night
      Billy was accompanied by an old confederate. As he was entering Chaudiere
      the previous evening, he had met John Brown, with his painted wagon and a
      new mottled horse. John Brown had news of importance to give; for, in the
      stable-yard of the village tavern, he had heard one habitant confide to
      another that the money for the new church was kept in the safe of the
      tailor-shop. John Brown was as ready to share in Billy's second enterprise
      as he had been to incite him to his first crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that as the Seigneur made his epigram and gloated over it, the
      five men, with horses at a convenient distance, armed to the teeth, broke
      stealthily into Charley's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered silently through the kitchen window, and made their way into
      the little hall. Two stood guard at the foot of the stairs, and three
      crept into the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      This night Jo Portugais was sleeping up-stairs, while Charley lay upon the
      bench in the tailor-shop. Charley heard the door open, heard unfamiliar
      steps, seized his pistol, and, springing up, with his back to the safe,
      called out loudly to Jo. As he dimly saw men rush at him, he fired. The
      bullet reached its mark, and one man fell dead. At that moment a
      dark-lantern was turned full on Charley, and a pistol was fired pointblank
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he fell, shot through the breast, the man who had fired dropped the
      lantern with a shriek of terror. He had seen the ghost of his
      brother-in-law-Charley Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a quaking cry of warning to the others, Billy bolted from the house,
      followed by his companions, two of whom were struggling with Jo Portugais
      on the stairway. These now also broke and ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo rushed into the shop, and saw, as he thought, Charley lying dead&mdash;saw
      the robber dead upon the floor. His master and friend gone, the conviction
      seized him that his own time had come. He would give himself to justice
      now&mdash;but to God's justice, not to man's. The robbers were four to
      one, and he would avenge his master's death and give his own life to do
      it! It was all the thought of a second. He rushed out after the robbers,
      shouting as he ran, to awake the villagers. He heard the marauders ahead
      of him, and, fleet of foot, rushed on. Reaching them as they mounted, he
      fired, and brought down his man&mdash;a shivering quack-doctor, who, like
      his leader, had seen a sight in the tailor-shop that struck terror to his
      soul. Two of the others then fired at Jo, who had caught a horse by the
      head. He fell without a sound, and lay upon his face&mdash;he did not hear
      the hoofs of the escaping horses nor any other sound. He had fallen
      without a pang beside the quackdoctor, whose medicines would never again
      quicken a pulse in his own body or any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind, in the village, frightened people flocked about the tailor-shop.
      Within, Mrs. Flynn and the Notary crudely but tenderly bound up the
      dreadful wound in Charley's side, while Rosalie pillowed his head on her
      bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a strange quietness Rosalie gave orders to the Notary and Mrs. Flynn.
      There was a light in her eyes&mdash;an unnatural light&mdash;of strength
      and presence of mind. Her hand was steady, and as gently as a mother with
      a child she wiped the moist forehead, and poured a little brandy between
      the set teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand back&mdash;give him air," she said, in a voice of authority to
      those who crowded round.
    </p>
    <p>
      People fell back in awe, for, amid tears and excitement and fear, this
      girl had a strange convincing calm. By the time Charley's wound was
      stopped, messengers were on the way to the Cure and the Seigneur. By
      Rosalie's instructions the dead body of the robber was removed, Charley's
      bed up-stairs was prepared for him, a fire was lighted, and twenty hands
      were ready to do accurately her will. Now and again she felt his pulse,
      and she watched his face intently. In her bitter sorrow her heart had a
      sort of thankfulness, for his head was on her breast, he was in her arms.
      It had been given her once more to come first to his rescue, and with one
      wild cry, unheard by any one, to call out his beloved name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world of Chaudiere, roused by the shooting, had then burst in upon
      them; but that one moment had been hers, no matter what came after. She
      had no illusions&mdash;she knew that the end was near: the end of all for
      him and for them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure entered and hurried forward. There was the seal of the parish
      intact on the door of the safe, but at what cost!
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has given his life for the church," he said, then commanded all to
      leave, save those needed to carry the wounded man up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still it was Rosalie that directed the removal. She held his hand; she saw
      that he was carefully laid down; she raised his head to a proper height;
      she moistened his lips and fanned him. Meanwhile the Cure fell upon his
      knees, and the noise of talk and whispering ceased in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently there was loud murmuring and shuffling of feet outside
      again, and Rosalie left the room hurriedly and went below to stop it. She
      met the men who were bringing the body of Jo Portugais into the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up-stairs the Cure's voice prayed: "Of Thy mercy, O Lord, hear our prayer.
      Grant that he be brought into Thy Church ere his last hour come. Forgive,
      O Lord&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley stirred and opened his eyes. He saw the Cure bowed in prayer; he
      heard the trembling voice. He touched the white head with his hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIX. IN WHICH CHARLEY MEETS A STRANGER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Cure came to his feet with a joyful cry. "Monsieur&mdash;my son," he
      said, bending over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it all over?" Charley asked calmly, almost cheerfully. Death now was
      the only solution of life's problems, and he welcomed it from the void.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure went to the door and locked it. The deepest desire of his life
      must here be uttered, his great aspiration be realised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son," he said, as he came softly to the bedside again, "you have given
      to us all you had&mdash;your charity, your wisdom, your skill. You have "&mdash;it
      was hard, but the man's wound was mortal, and it must be said "you have
      consecrated our new church with your blood. You have given all to us; we
      will give all to you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a soft knocking at the door. He went and opened it a very
      little. "He is conscious, Rosalie," he whispered. "Wait&mdash;wait&mdash;one
      moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the Seigneur's voice saying that Jo was gone, and that all the
      robbers had escaped, save the two disposed of by Charley and Jo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure turned to the bed once more. "What did he say about Jo?" Charley
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is dead, my son, and the quack-doctor also. The others have escaped."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley turned his face away. "Au revoir, Jo," he said into the great
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was silence for a moment, while outside the door a girl prayed,
      with an old woman's arm around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure leaned over Charley again. "Shall not the sacraments of the
      Church comfort you in your last hours?" he said. "It is the way, the
      truth, and the life. It is the Voice that says: 'Peace' to the vexed mind.
      Human intellect is vanity; only the soul survives. Will you not hear the
      Voice? Will you not give us who love and honour you the right to make you
      ours for ever? Will you not come to the bosom of that Church for which you
      have given all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell them so," Charley said, and he motioned towards the window, under
      which the people were gathered.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a glad exclamation the Cure hastened to the window, and, in a voice
      of sorrowful exultation, spoke to the people below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley reckoned swiftly with his fate. What was there now to do? If his
      wound was not mortal, what tragedy might now come! For Billy's hand&mdash;the
      hand of Kathleen's brother&mdash;had brought him low. If the robbers and
      murderers were captured, he must be dragged into the old life, and to what
      an issue&mdash;all the old problems carried into more terrible conditions.
      And Rosalie&mdash;in his half-consciousness he had felt her near him; he
      felt her near him now. Rosalie&mdash;in any case, what could there be for
      her? Nothing. He had heard the Cure whisper her name at the door. She was
      outside-praying for him. He stretched out a hand as though he saw her, and
      his lips framed her name. In his weakness and fading life he had no
      anguish in the thought of her. Life and Love were growing distant though
      he loved her as few love and live. She would be removed from want by him&mdash;there
      were the pearls and the money in the safe with the money of the Church;
      there was the letter to the Cure, his last testament, leaving all to her.
      He, sleeping, would fear no foe; she, awake in the living world, would
      hold him in dear remembrance. Death were the better thing for all. Then
      Kathleen in her happiness would be at peace; and even Billy might go
      unmolested, for, who was there to recognise Billy, now that Portugais was
      dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the Cure's voice at the window&mdash;"Oh, my dear people, God has
      given him to us at last. I go now to prepare him for his long journey, to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley realised and shuddered. Receive the sacraments of the Church? Be
      made ready by the priest for his going hence&mdash;end all the soul's
      interrogations, with the solving of his own mortal problems? Say "I
      believe," confess his sins, and, receiving absolution, lie down in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly raised himself on his elbow, flinging his body over. The
      bandage of his wound was displaced, and blood gushed out upon the white
      clothes of the bed. "Rosalie!" he gasped. "Rosalie, my love! God keep..."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sank back he heard the priest's anguished voice above him, calling
      for help. He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosalie&mdash;" he whispered. The priest ran and unlocked the door, and
      Rosalie entered, followed by the Seigneur and Mrs. Flynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quick! Quick!" said the priest. "The bandage slipped."
    </p>
    <p>
      The bandage slipped&mdash;or was it slipped? Who knows!
    </p>
    <p>
      Blind with agony, and as in a direful dream, Rosalie made her way to the
      bed. The sight of his ensanguined body roused her, and, murmuring his name&mdash;continually
      murmuring his name&mdash;she assisted Mrs. Flynn to bind up the wound
      again. Standing where she stood when she had stayed Louis Trudel's arm
      long ago, with an infinite tenderness she touched the scar-the scar of the
      cross&mdash;on his breast. Terrible as was her grief, her heart had its
      comfort in the thought&mdash;who could rob her of that for ever?&mdash;that
      he would die a martyr. It did not matter now who knew the story of her
      love. It could not do him harm. She was ready to proclaim it to all the
      world. And those who watched knew that they were in the presence of a
      great human love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest made ready to receive the unconscious man into the Church. Had
      Charley not said, "Tell them so?" Was it not now his duty to say the
      sacred offices over a son of the Church in his last bitter hour? So it was
      done while he lay unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      For hours he lay still, and then the fevered blood, poisoned by the bullet
      which had brought him down, made him delirious, gave him hallucinations&mdash;open-eyed
      illusions. All the time Rosalie knelt at the foot of the bed, her piteous
      tearless eyes for ever fixed on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards evening, with an unnatural strength, he sat up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See," he whispered, "that woman in the corner there. She has come to take
      me, but I will not go." Fantasy after fantasy possessed him-fantasy,
      strangely mixed with facts of his own past. Now it was Kathleen, now
      Billy, now Jo Portugais, now John Brown, now Suzon Charlemagne at the Cote
      Dorion, again Jo Portugais. In strange, touching sentences he spoke to
      them, as though they were present before him. At length he stopped
      abruptly, and gazed straight before him&mdash;over the head of Rosalie
      into the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See," he said, pointing, "who is that? Who? I can't see his face&mdash;it
      is covered. So tall-so white! He is opening his arms to me. He is coming&mdash;closer&mdash;closer.
      Who is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Death, my son," said the priest in his ear, with a pitying
      gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure's voice seemed to calm the agitated sense, to bring it back to
      the outer precincts of understanding. There was an awe-struck silence as
      the dying man fumbled, fumbled, over his breast, found his eye-glass, and,
      with a last feeble effort, raised it to his eye, shining now with an
      unearthly fire. The old interrogation of the soul, the elemental habit
      outlived all else in him. The idiosyncrasy of the mind automatically
      expressed itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg&mdash;your&mdash;pardon," he whispered to the imagined figure, and
      the light died out of his eyes, "have I&mdash;ever&mdash;been&mdash;introduced&mdash;to
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the hour of your birth, my son," said the priest, as a sobbing cry
      came from the foot of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Charley did not hear. His ears were for ever closed to the voices of
      life and time.

      CHAPTER LX. THE HAND AT THE DOOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      The eve of the day of the memorable funeral two belated visitors to the
      Passion Play arrived in the village, unknowing that it had ended, and of
      the tragedy which had set a whole valley mourning; unconscious that they
      shared in the bitter fortunes of the tailor-man, of whom men and women
      spoke with tears. Affected by the gloom of the place, the two visitors at
      once prepared for their return journey, but the manner of the tailorman's
      death arrested their sympathies, touched the humanity in them. The woman
      was much impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They asked to see the body of the man. They were taken to the door of the
      tailor-shop, while their horses were being brought round. Within the house
      itself they were met by an old Irishwoman, who, in response to their wish
      "to see the brave man's body," showed them into a room where a man lay
      dead with a bullet through his heart. It was the body of Jo Portugais,
      whose master and friend lay in another room across the hallway. The lady
      turned back in disappointment&mdash;the dead man was little like a hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Irishwoman had meant to deceive her, for at this moment a girl who
      loved the tailor was kneeling beside his body, and, if possible, Mrs.
      Flynn would have no curious eyes look upon that scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the visitors came into the hall again, the man said: "There was
      another; Kathleen&mdash;a woodsman." But standing by the nearly closed
      door, behind which lay the dead tailor of Chaudiere&mdash;they could see
      the holy candles flickering within&mdash;Kathleen whispered "We've seen
      the tailor&mdash;that's enough. It's only the woodsman there. I prefer
      not, Tom."
    </p>
    <p>
      With his fingers at the latch, the man hesitated, even as Mrs. Flynn
      stepped apprehensively forward; then, shrugging a shoulder, he responded
      to Kathleen's hand on his arm. They went down the stairs together, and out
      to their carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they drove away, Kathleen said: "It's strange that men who do such fine
      things should look so commonplace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other one might have been more uncommon," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder!" she said, with a sigh of relief, as they passed the bounds of
      the village. Then she caught herself flushing, for she suddenly realised
      that the exclamation was one so often on the lips of a dead, disgraced man
      whose name she once had borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the door of the little room upstairs had opened to the fingers of the
      man beside her, the tailor of Chaudiere, though dead, would have been
      dearly avenged.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXI. THE CURE SPEAKS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Cure stood with his back to the ruins of the church, at his feet two
      newly made graves, and all round, with wistful faces, crowds of reverent
      habitants. A benignant sorrow made his voice in perfect temper with the
      pensive striving of this latest day of spring. At the close of his address
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I owe you much, my people. I owe him more, for it was given him, who knew
      not God, to teach us how to know Him better. For his past, it is not given
      you to know. It is hidden in the bosom of the Church. Sinner he once was,
      criminal never, as one can testify who knows all"&mdash;he turned to the
      Abbe Rossignol, who stood beside him, grave and compassionate&mdash;"and
      his sins were forgiven him. He is the one sheaf which you and I may carry
      home rejoicing from the pagan world of unbelief. What he had in life he
      gave to us, and in death he leaves to our church all that he has not left
      to a woman he loved&mdash;to Rosalie Evanturel."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a gasping murmur among the people, but they stilled again, and
      strained to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He leaves her a little fortune, and to us all else he had. Let us pray
      for his soul, and let us comfort her who, loving deeply, reaped no harvest
      of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The law may never reach his ruthless murderers, for there is none to
      recognise their faces; and were they ten times punished, how should it
      avail us now! Let us always remember that, in his grave, our friend bears
      on his breast the little iron cross we held so dear. That is all we could
      give&mdash;our dearest treasure. I pray God that, scarring his breast in
      life, it may heal all his woes in death, and be a saving image on his
      bosom in the Presence at the last."
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hands in benediction.

    <h2>
      EPILOGUE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Never again was there a Passion Play in the Chaudiere Valley. Spring-times
      and harvests and long winters came and went, and a blessing seemed to be
      upon the valley, for men prospered, and no untoward things befel the
      people. So it was for twenty years, wherein there had been going and
      coming in quiet. Some had gone upon short mortal journeys and had come
      back, some upon long immortal voyages, and had never returned. Of the last
      were the Seigneur and a woman once a Magdalene; but in a house beside a
      beautiful church, with a noble doorway, lived the Cure, M. Loisel, aged
      and serene. There never was a day, come rain or shine, in which he was not
      visited by a beautiful woman, whose life was one with the people of the
      valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sorrow in the parish which the lady did not share, with the
      help of an old Irishwoman called Mrs. Flynn. Was there sickness in the
      parish, her hand smoothed the pillow and soothed the pain. Was there
      trouble anywhere, her face brought light to the door way. Did any suffer
      ill-repute, her word helped to restore the ruined name. They did not know
      that she forgave so much in all the world, because she thought she had so
      much in herself to forgive.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was ever called "Madame Rosalie," and she cherished the name, and gave
      commands that when her grave came to be made near to a certain other
      grave, Madame Rosalie should be carved upon the stone. Cheerfulness and
      serenity were ever with her, undisturbed by wish to probe the mystery of
      the life which had once absorbed her own. She never sought to know whence
      the man came; it was sufficient to know whither he had gone, and that he
      had been hers for a brief dream of life. It was better to have lived the
      one short thrilling hour with all its pain, than never to have known what
      she knew or felt what she had felt. The mystery deepened her romance, and
      she was even glad that the ruffians who slew him were never brought to
      justice. To her mind they were but part of the mystic machinery of fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      For her the years had given many compensations, and so she told the Cure,
      one midsummer day, when she brought to visit him the orphaned son of
      Paulette Dubois, graduated from his college in France and making ready to
      go to the far East.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have had more than I deserve&mdash;a thousand times," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure smiled, and laid a gentle hand upon her own. "It is right for you
      to think so," he said, "but after a long life, I am ready to say that, one
      way or another, we earn all the real happiness we have. I mean the real
      happiness&mdash;the moments, my child. I once had a moment full of
      happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When my heart first went out to him"&mdash;he turned his face towards the
      churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was a great man," she said proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure looked at her benignly: she was a woman, and she had loved the
      man. He had, however, come to a stage of life where greatness alone seemed
      of little moment. He forbore to answer her, but he pressed her hand.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
